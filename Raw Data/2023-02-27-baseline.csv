Consent to Participate in Research



Title of study:  Personalizing Personality

Investigator: Dr. Emorie D. Beck, PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology, UC Davis



Introduction and Purpose 

You are being invited to join a research study.  



The purpose of this study is to see if allowing individuals to tell us which questions we should ask them provide better summaries of their personalities and their daily lives than standard batteries of personality and daily life. 



If you agree to be in this research, you will be asked to complete one baseline survey and 105 experience sampling surveys. In this baseline survey, you will complete a variety of measures about your personality, your emotions, and your daily life.   It will take about 45 minutes to complete the survey. In the experience sampling portion, you will complete up to 5, 2 minute surveys per day for up to 3 weeks. Each of these will take about 2-3 minutes to complete. At the end of the three weeks, you will receive a personalized report summarizing your experience sampling responses.



There is no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study. We hope that the research will help you to understand your daily thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and experiences.



The risks of this research are minimal. Some of the questions might make you feel uncomfortable or upset.  You do not have to answer any of the questions you do not want to answer.  



Confidentiality

As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk. Your responses to the survey will not include information that identifies you. This identifiable information will be handled as confidentially as possible. However, individuals from UC Davis who oversee research may access your data during audits or other monitoring activities. 



To minimize the risks of breach of confidentiality, we will store all identifiable information (name, phone number for text messages) separately from all survey responses in a password protected, encrypted file. Your survey results will only be linked to you via a participant ID. Only you and the PI (Dr. Beck) will have access to this ID and to identifiable information.



The data we collect with your identifiable information (e.g., your name, medical record number, or date of birth) as a part of this study may be used to answer other research questions or may be shared with other investigators for other research. If we do so, we will remove all identifiable information before use or sharing. Once identifiers have been removed, we will not ask your consent for the use or sharing of your data in other research. In addition, data that have been de-identified will be uploaded to the Open Science Framework for other researchers to access and use.



Compensation

To thank you for participating in this research study, you will two forms of compensation, First, for the baseline survey, you will receive a $10 Amazon gift card emailed to you within 2 weeks after you complete it. Second, for every experience sampling survey you complete, you will receive $0.50 (maximum $63 for perfect completion rate) as an Amazon gift card emailed to you within 2 weeks of the end of the experience sampling portion of the study. If your completion rate is at 90% (94 surveys), you will receive a bonus of $10 applied to your experience sampling Amazon gift card. 



Rights

Taking part in research is completely voluntary.  You are free to decline to take part in the project.  You can decline to answer any questions and you can stop taking part in the project at any time.  Whether or not you choose to take part, or answer any question, or stop taking part in the project, there will be no penalty to you or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.



Questions

If you have any questions about this research, please feel free to contact the investigator at 573-690-0133 or edbeck@ucdavis.edu.



If you have any questions about your rights or treatment as a research participant in this study, please contact the UC Davis, Institutional Review Board by phone: 916 703 9158 or by email: HS-IRBEducation@ucdavis.edu.



If you agree to take part in the research, please print a copy of this page to keep for future reference, then click on the “Accept” button below.”",What is your name?

We want to understand your daily psychological, social, and emotional experiences; your behaviors; the contexts you inhabit; and your daily life overall. To do so, we want to give you the opportunity to tell us what questions we should ask you related to your emotions, thoughts, behaviors, contexts, goals, identities, challenges, and more in everyday life. 



Please describe your typical daily thoughts, experiences, behaviors, contexts, beliefs, desires, and/or anything else you think is important below. You may say, for example, that “I’m usually very energetic, but I get tired after lunch;” “Most days, I feel excited about what I need to do, but on Wednesdays I have a lab course that ruins my mood;” or ""When I'm around peers, I often feel out of place because I am a first gen student."" Also think about your reasons for experiences/behaviors/etc. Is there another reason you get tired after lunch other than the time of day? What about that lab course ruins your mood? Do specific peers trigger your first gen identity more than others? There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is simply to help you think about yourself and everyday experiences as well as what you think drives those. 



Write as much as you think is necessary to understand your daily life. There are no length limits, but please write at least two paragraphs. Richer descriptions will provide us more information to help you understand whether your perception of your daily life mirrors your actual experiences, while less rich descriptions may limit our ability to answer these questions. It might be helpful to think about the people you might be with, the places you might go, and the things you might do in the next few weeks.

Next, we’d like you to take this text and try to extract words or phrases that we’ll have you rate in your daily life. For example, the phrase “I’m usually very energetic, but I get tired after lunch” could be broken into 2 (“energetic” and “tired after lunch”) or 3 (“energetic,” “tired,” and “lunch”) items.



There’s no right or wrong way to break these up. Rather, we want to break these up as they are meaningful for you. If, for example, lunch doesn’t matter much outside this context, then we may not need to measure it separately from tired. But, if you think your tiredness is driven by other factors than proximity to lunch, then you would want to split it up. We will be asking you to rate how true each of the words or phrases you provide are in the moment in the next phase of the study, so also think about how to phrase them to make answering that prompt on a response scale from 1 ""Strongly Disagree"" to 5 ""Strongly Agree.""

I have to be on my phone for a while playing games to get up. I work night shift 7 days on and then 7 days off so my sleeping schedule changes depending on the week.

I spend most of my time with my boyfriend and some time with my family on weeks where I don't have work. I watch a lot of TV and tiktok and I feel at most peace when I crochet. I feel more energetic when I work out but that's only 3 times a week. I feel indifferent when at work. It's good work at a hospital so I feel satisfied that I'm helping people, but it's really monotonous work in a lab.

I have 3-4 lectures in the morning back to back, then attend a lunch talk (which offers free food so that's the highlight of my day), and have labs or more lectures in the afternoon. If I have more lectures right after the lunch talk, I most likely will fall asleep - perhaps from food coma or maybe because I get tired. I'm surrounded by a cohort of the smartest people I've ever worked with. I have always been the top student in my prior education experience, but here in vet school, everyone was a top student. I get stressed when my peers seem to know a lot more than I do or have mastered the lecture materials a lot better. 

However, I'm involved in a lot of extracurricular activities and I'm proud for what I do. Although they take away my study time, I enjoy organizing wet labs, provide free care for pets, and more.

Recently, one of my suite-mates asked me to buy his friend a cake and didn’t offer to pay for it. Normally, if it were another mate, I wouldn’t have had an issue with this. I would say this interaction had upset me because of the individual who asked. For some context, I’m a first-gen hispanic woman and he is a white middle-class male. I understand how bad this must sound, but when he asked me that question I got upset. 
     Being white isn’t bad, but self-awareness of one’s privilege is always important. In the moment, I felt that he was entitled. I come from a low income family and attend UC Davis as a first-gen student. Despite my background, I always contribute to the dorm to the best of my abilities. My roommate and I constantly buy the cleaning supplies and accessories for the suite and we never even received a “thank you”. 
      I couldn’t wrap my head around why he would ask ME to buy HIS friend a cake - it made me all the more upset when I remembered he had more money than me. I would assume my pent-up frustration gradually built up and burst with that simple question. Of course, I didn’t lash out at him. I simply smiled. Ever since that encounter, I’ve been second guessing my character and I question whether or not I am drowning in my own self pity.

I say ""traditionally"" because now I'm aware that taking a breather for mental health is a form of being productive, but I digress. I'm either spending hours in class writing notes, studying, obsession over housing for next year, and signing up for SONA paid research participation, or getting completely absorbed in some sort of media and then spending hours trying to consume as much content from it as possible.

It's been pretty hard, I tested positive for Covid the day I was supposed to return and only came back yesterday, so I've missed the first 2-3 days of all of my classes. Luckily though I have a 4 day weekend, Friday-Monday off every week. All my classes this quarter are GE's that I could easily earn credit for at a CC if I fail, but nevertheless I've been raised with the mentality of anything lower than a B+ is failing so it stresses me out. 

I'm usually pretty anxious in the mornings-afternoons, and then very late at night. Usually it's because I'm overwhelmed and overthinking about all the things I have to do that day (mornings-afternoons) and then doing the same for the day to come (very late at night, like 12-2am). It probably doesn't help that I don't eat that much while I'm at college, usually just one meal a day and then a snack or two. In the later afternoon and for most of the night I try to completely relax and pick up wherever I left off last time in my media consumption. 

I would hang out with friends, but so far college has been a constant overstimulation for me. I'm used to having 1-2 close friends, then a lot of casual friends I see every so often, but now I have three roommates that are loud and are from a completely different crowd than I'm from. And with the looming uncomfortableness around the fact that my roommate threatened to kill herself last quarter (resulting in me having to call 911, which she then found out and got angry at me for), any form of social interaction with them is even more draining than talking to people usually are. I have one on campus friend (which I'm grateful for, if I had any more I would be socially drained 24/7) who is my current future roommate for next year, and although he's really nice and I'm happy we're friends, he's a very social guy and wants to hang out extremely often. I don't usually mind because when I'm with him, just like my other two good friends who are at different colleges, I get really energized talking with him, but afterwards I can't do anything but stare at a screen or nap for a few hours.

Besides going to classes Tuesday-Thursday, doing the occasional SONA study, and playing D&D with a group of more casual friends every Friday (with the one really good friend I mentioned earlier DMing), I spend the rest of my time on my computer or phone, usually my computer. I mainly play video games or watch TV shows/movies, but another large chunk I spend writing goofy things on Google Docs with a childhood friend of mine. I also spend a lot of time categorizing and keeping track of the things I play/watch, I have a multitude of lists and Google Sheets tracking my progress and opinions on almost all the media I consume.

I would stay up watching shows until the morning and that habit of sleeping late has continued until now. I get tired easily due to being depressed, lack of vitamin D maybe. I have trouble getting up in the morning and getting ready. I’m always in a hurry to get to places such as classes, actives, parties, events, work. I function better in high stress situations because I am forced to act. I enjoy talking to my best friends for hours and keeping up with my favorite music group and biggest interest: BTS. They make me very happy and give me energy. 

I have trouble eating healthy meals because I am always in a rush and rarely feel motivated to cook. I struggle understanding whether my procrastination/inaction on things such as homework, taking up opportunities, taking care of myself is due to laziness or depression. Being a good person and holding myself to a high moral standard is important but it often turns out to be more people pleasing. That prevents me from making the choices I really want because I am more concerned with being accepted by others. This comes from wanting to see my family happy when I was younger. I feel like i have to put others before myself to truly be happy because I hate confrontation and want good relationships with others. 

My main conflict in life is with healing myself from childhood issues. Despite moving away, i feel that my upbringing still has a great effect on me. While I wish I could change the past and have more emotional support and understanding from my parents I have to accept that isn’t possible and I have to improve myself where I am right now. 

I feel like im always in a constant cycle of ups and downs and I am not in control of my life. So I enjoy it a lot when I have the motivation too. I am very outgoing with my friends, but quiet and awkward in new settings and in big groups. I overthink a lot, again, because I want to make the right decisions. People’s approval is important to me. I love singing and listening to music. I like making my loved ones happy. I feel often that my happiness depends on others rather than myself. I feel too dependent on my parents and want to change that but it’s hard with how high tuition and rent is. Also, because finding the motivation to do anything is difficult for me.

This is when I typically do my “whiteboard tasks.” I have my goals for the day written on a white board, and they consist of reading specific papers, writing drafts and emails, watching lectures on stats and coding, going through tutorials or doing lab tasks (e.g., converting physio output into an analyzable format) in R, and recently, applying to jobs. There is no strict ordering to these tasks, but I usually do some combination of them on days I don’t go into lab for lab meetings (tuesdays 2:30-3:30pm) or one on one meetings (variable). These tasks are what I spend the bulk of my weekdays doing, and I feel most accomplished and “right with myself” if I have a productive days engaging in a combinations of these tasks. A productive day is usually interpreted as finishing 80-90% of the whiteboard tasks. My partner comes homes around 3:30pm and we usually talk about our days and plan on taking our dog on a walk. I very much value my partners arrival and our conversation, and if it doesn’t happen because either of us is busy, I am usually disappointed or annoyed. 

I am typically at a neutral affective level throughout that time (waking up to 3pm), unless I procrastinate. If I procrastinate I typically feel self critical and a little guilty. My time sitting at the computer is usually broken up by taking my dog out on a walk, cleaning the apartment, and eating lunch. I have a burst of energy and positive affect when I go outside with my dog at 12pm and when I go out around 4:30pm with my partner and my dog. If I do not go out with my partner around 4:30pm it almost always because I am skating with friends. Of course, this activity has a strong effect on my positive mood, feelings of affiliation, and sometimes, accomplishment. I eat dinner around 6, and that process (including cooking) is almost always an enjoyable one. After dinner I typically read a little next to my partner or we watch a tv show/movie. Some nights I play online games with friends from college and high school. 


My locations are usually constrained to:
My apartment
Research lab
Campus (walking dog)
Skate spot (skatepark, campus, BART station)
Friends house 

On weekends I try to get work (same as above) done in the morning but usually by noon we have plans to either go to parks, friends homes (local or out of town), play tennis/pickle ball, skate, or go on a hike. All of these activities almost always include friends and I feel very close and comfortable with them.

It's a bit of a struggle to get up despite my alarm going off at 7:30 because I usually don't fall asleep until 1 am or later-- whether that be because we were hanging out for too late, or I was just on my phone for too long. Afterwards, I go back to my dorm and work on classwork until my classes begin at noon. The exception to this rule is on Fridays, in which we get breakfast at 9 and my classes start at 10. I dislike this, not just because of the change from my routine, but also because I have to go to two discussions on Fridays that force me to interact outside of my friend group. I'd say that I have a fair amount of friends, with our total group adding to around 10 people, and I get along with them much more than I ever did with my friends in high school. We all live on the same floor and mesh well. However, I have yet to make any friends in my major or in classes. In lectures I keep to myself and in discussions I only talk about what is relevant to the assignment at hand. I don't see the point in trying to interact further when I know it'll be too difficult to pass as anything other than visibly queer and neurodivergent.
After classes, I head back in the afternoon and either return to working on schoolwork or have some time to relax.

As a brief introduction, I am a first year biological sciences major, with an interest in physiology and cellular biology. I use they/them pronouns. I have an interest in the arts as well, specifically pottery, sculpture, and glassblowing. I am Chinese American, and my Chinese roots do influence my daily life, mainly through the types of foods and activities I pursue on a daily basis. In the near future, I am looking forward to Lunar New Year and all the festivities that are going to ensue. 

In terms of my daily/weekly routines, I typically get up pretty early and after about thirty minutes have a decent amount of energy which I usually maintain until about three or so at which point I lose energy till about 6:30 when I have dinner, after which I usually have a fair amount of energy again until 12:00-1:00 am. My chemistry lab is a drag on my daily life, (Tuesday 4:00-7:00 pm) and it is a weekly source of dread but other than that none of my courses are particularly bothersome. I like to spend my time in the ceramics studio at the craft center after my courses are finished when time permits as I feel as though giving myself the opportunity to be creative after learning content through lectures for several hours straight is good for my mental health, it helps me decompress a little bit. I have no courses on Thursday and I look forward to having a day to play catch up a little bit and relax.

I feel less excited on Tuesday and Thursday, just because the classes aren't as exciting. I also have a very late lab on Thursday which is sometimes stressful. I really enjoy chemistry, and look forward to every lecture (M,W,R). I usually enjoy lab, but I can get stressed out about having to work with my partner and finishing on time. School doesn't really stress me out except around finals. I get very excited to learn new things. I spend most of my day alone, either going to class or just hanging around campus. I enjoy the solitude and freedom that it entails. I don't have to ask if I'm allowed to go somewhere or anything, like I had to at home. 

The evening is when my mood tends to go down. Sometimes it stays fine, but when it doesn't, it definitely feels like depression, which I'm very familiar with. I've been on antidepressants for over 6 months and have gotten much better since arriving at college. The only time I feel down is evenings, typically triggered by some kind of interaction with my roommates. I have been friends with them since middle school, but sometimes they make me feel like the odd one out. I'm the only guy, I grew up with the most siblings, and I'm transgender. Also, they are both really into reading and are always talking about books. I wish I could enjoy reading, and sometimes I do, but it's very hard for me to focus on the page for long enough to actually finish it. Almost every night we do a crossword puzzle together, which can either be really fun or terrible. It turns terrible (triggers my depression) when something happens that makes me feel dumb, like I don't know an answer that is so obvious to both my roommates. 

Once I feel depressed like that, all I can do is lie in bed silently and listen to music, usually sad songs. I fall asleep and feel better in the morning.",excited in morning,stressful,lab,time alone,evening,mood drop,triggers,depression,odd one out,roommates,medication,,,,,,,,,,1,2,5,5,3,3,4,4,3,2,2,4,5,4,2,3,4,4,1,4,5,5,3,2,4,2,4,2,5,5,4,4,4,5,3,2,4,3,5,1,3,4,4,4,5,3,2,3,5,4,2,2,5,5,1,2,5,5,1,2,2,2,2,5,5,3,4,4,4,5,logical,quiet,determined,1,1,2,4,2,3,2,4,1,2,2,4,3,2,1,3,1,2,2,1,8,2,6,5,3,6,6,8,8,3,4,4,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,4,1,3,5,3,3,7,3,1,2,5,8,3,5,7,2,2,6,6,4,3,5,5,3,5,5,2,6,1,2,2,4,4,1,2,6,4,6,3,5,2,1,4,3,2,1,1,2,5,2,4,3,6,1,1,6,5,2,2,3,3,4,3,1,4,3,3,2,3,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,2,2,4,4,6,6,3,6,4,6,7,7,5,3,3,6,7,7,1,1,1,3,7,4,3,4,5,4,3,4,3,4,5,5,4,3,4,4,3,5,5,3,5,2,5,2,2004,"1,3",,3,1,,2,,1,2,2,7,5,1,"Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior",,Chemistry,Public Health,4,16069

in my free time, i like to read and spend time with my roommates. because my schoolwork has such a set routine to it, i leave my free time less structured and tend not to make too many strict plans. spend my weekends sleeping in, reading, and making plans day by day.

I am a third year student here at UC Davis and I am majoring in Human Development. I currently work at Sweet and Shavery in downtown Davis. When I’m at work I’m casually happy, this is because I am a person who like to interact with people. I’m a social person with no social life. This is why I’m currently going through the motions of life. My first year of college was online line and because of this I wasn’t given the opportunity to make friends. My second year wasn’t the best either, my only friend was kicked out of college and as for making friends my third year, there has been no luck. I do have a boyfriend who makes me very happy. We are gonna make a year in May. We meet my first year of college in my home town. On the daily I go to school I’m the mornings and I’m the afternoons I go to work. Since I have no social life, when I’m not at school or work I’m in my apartment. At the moment I am going through a room change because my current roommates aren’t the best. So during the next few weeks I’m going to be moving into a new apartment which I am really looking forward to. I will finally get my own room for the first time ever and I will no longer be in a toxic environment. As for school, I am taking a pretty easy load this quarter so I won’t have much stress there. Work isn’t stressful either, it’s an ice cream shop so it’s relatively easy. My only problem is my room situation and hopefully that will be resolved soon. I am a first generation student and because this it has been a lot harder for me to find my way around college life. I don’t feel like I fit in in most places. This is also a big problem for me when it comes to making friends. A lot of students have parents that have once attended college and so they have people to guide them and give them pointers. I on other hand didn’t. I am also a Latina who is Catholic and is a great believer in family and there traditions. I grew up in Los Angeles and Davis is nothing like LA. I sometimes get homesick. I miss the food and the different traditions that I would do with my family. Overall over these next three weeks my emotions might be all over the place.

Everyday is a constant struggle of who is going to take and pickup my other younger siblings from school. Because most of the time it is me who does this, my days are filled. In the morning I usually wake up to cloth and feed my siblings. When waking up in the morning my usual thoughts are about how tired I am and how I wish to sleep. This is likely because I stay up to do school work or other things and wake up early. Another important factor is that I get bad headaches majority of the time, so the first thing I do is take medicine. This makes me spiral into my thoughts in how I wished the doctors payed more attention to my problem, rather than giving up and just giving medicine to control it for the day. 
Once I have taken my siblings to school I go back home and prepare to go to school. Most of my thoughts during this time are about what could happen on the way there, which leads to many plan b’s. This is a cause of my anxiety which has led me to not do things out of my comfort zone, and driving has always been on the top. While driving too school it is one of the times my thoughts start to run wild. This could be things I need to do, or what I plan to do once I get home. The rest of the day I mostly do homework. Unlike other people I know I never go out because I for some reason don’t want to and would rather be in bed than talking to people. Once I go to bed this is when I really start to go deep into my thoughts. Not always but a lot of times I could be awake for 1-2 hours in just thinking. Most of my thoughts during this time are a result of my anxiety and so they are not pretty.

I feel as if this will make me happier and bring my life more balance. I’ve recently started drinking 2 liters of water a day, incorporating at least one bowl of fruit into my diet, and began going to the gym at 8 pm everyday. I’m very proud of myself recently as I feel I’ve grown more productive. I recently applied for EBT and I even go out of my way to complete research studies for money. 
    Coming as a first generational student from a low income family, this is progress. My whole life I have been so used to pushing my health aside and so with this I feel free. I finally have time for myself and self-care which drastically helps my mood. Not only that, I’ve been practicing time management and am currently academically thriving.

I haven't really met any other students who are Mexican or Latino. I guess that's why I also feel out of place here. My hometown had a completely different demographic that it really does sometimes make me feel homesick. I try and talk to my friends at least every day or every other day but, I know that they also have their own lives and are busy. I don't want to be too much of a bother but it does make me feel so much better when I talk to them. 
     Another thing that kind of bothers me is how tired I usually am. I try and get 8 hours of sleep every night yet I still feel tired. I'm not quite sure why this happens. Perhaps I'm not getting the proper nutrients to keep me energetic. Everyday from around 6-8 pm I want to take a fat nap.

I look forward to meal times at the dining commons so that I could talk with my friends and eat. The past week, I have been either going to the gym, rock climbing, or dancing daily; sometimes in the early morning at 8AM. I feel that exercising and getting my body moving really helps get my mood up and makes me feel even better. I enjoy bike rides to class as well.

When I'm in class, I find it hard to pay attention and listen to my professors. I tend to get my work done, though, and I feel satisfied when I get things checked off in Canvas. I do look forward to my math class, because my Professor sounds like Gru from Despicable Me. I find he is also a very good Professor. Other lectures, however, are quite boring to me.

I have clubs that I look forward to on Mondays and Fridays; both being Christian club. I am working on growing in my faith.

School In general makes me tired and stressed often. I live off campus so getting to school is stressful and often anxiety inducing when the bus is late. Also my classes this quarter are pretty early in the morning, so that leads to being tired throughout the day. I also have a heavier work load so I am staying up later and still waking up early so again tiredness is a constant theme. I don't have classes on Fridays which is nice so it's a good break from school , so that makes me happy.

Whenever I call my family I am happy, and tend to be in a high happier mood than normal. 

My roommate is fun to be around, I feel comfortable and safe with her. I don't feel as safe or comfortable with my housemates, it's a little more like walking on thin ice and trying to not make anyone mad. Some times certain of my house mates makes me mad and angry when they do or tell me dumb stuff. In one of my clubs I feel safe  and comfortable and free to be myself. Sometimes in class when I don't understand the class content and it seems like everyone else does I often feel like I don't belong in college at all because I'm not smart enough for it.

However, I have a 10 am class on Mondays and Wednesdays that I can't miss so I have to get up around 8:30 am. I like to stay in bed for a while in the mornings and typically I'll go on my phone and use social media or entertainment apps like YouTube or Twitter. On weekends, sometimes I don't get out of bed until 11-12. On days when I have an early class that's recorded and attendance isn't mandatory, I find myself waking up at the right time and debating whether I should actually go, usually based on how tired I feel. If I feel too tired, I often will go back to sleep for a few hours. My morning routine always consists of breakfast and coffee (I'm really into making coffee). I'm usually excited about making coffee but less excited about making breakfast. I don't have the energy or motivation in the mornings to make something that takes a lot of effort so I typically eat whatever seems the easiest at the time. During all of my meals, I enjoy watching a YouTube video, usually about whatever obsession I'm into at the time. 
After breakfast, I try to remember to take my anxiety meds (5mg of Lexapro) and an allergy pill if it feels like I need it. Then, if I need to go out, I will, and if I don't need to go out then I look at whatever I need to get done and try to be productive until I need to go out. If I don't have anything to do that day or don't need to go out, I usually stay home all day and just play games, hang out with friends on discord, or watch YouTube/Netflix/etc. Sometimes I crave boba or fast food, though, and so in those instances, I'll go out (either biking or walking depending on my energy levels and the distance I need to travel) and I'll either bring it back to my apartment or just eat it there (typically alone). I do a lot of activities alone unless I make plans with friends or run into a roommate. I think I just enjoy doing activities alone because I can control exactly what I do and how I do it. I also consider myself an introvert and need alone time to recharge. However, I do enjoy hanging out with people because it gets lonely unless I do. 
Lately, I've been trying to become more healthy. I think about my food options a lot more than I used to and typically try my best to have a good balance of foods. I love sweet treats though so I typically will have at least 1 per day even if I know I probably shouldn't. For lunch, I typically have more energy than in the morning so if I have enough energy/motivation I'll actually cook something. I am not the biggest fan of cooking so I typically need a good amount of motivation to cook something. Otherwise, I'll microwave some leftovers or if I'm out and about I'll buy something from campus stores or downtown. 
When it comes to my anxiety,  I typically feel the most anxious in my classes, especially if it's a class where I am required to talk. For me, anxiety is more about overthinking things than anything and wanting to present to the world as relatively likable and normal. I think about the noises I make, whether I'm being too loud doing certain actions, whether it would it be weird to drink water/coffee right now, if I pull down my mask to drink do I have anything on my face that people would find gross, if I raise my hand will I get it wrong or say something dumb, do I smell bad and can people around me smell me, and things of that nature. After a hangout with someone, especially if I really want them to like me, I think about all the things I've done during the hangout and think about whether it was weird or rude. All of these thoughts go for texting and social media, too. 
Afternoons typically go one of two ways: I either have the motivation to get my work done or I don't have the motivation and slack off (social media, sudoku puzzles, YouTube/Netflix/etc). If I get my work done in the afternoon then in the evenings I watch YouTube or do something else I find fun until I have to shower and go to bed. If I don't get my work done in the afternoon then I get it done in the evenings instead and then call it a night. I typically only do what is required though and I don't usually get much of a headstart on things unless it's supposed to be a busier week. Regardless, though, I always eat dinner. Whether I actually cook or just microwave again depends on my energy/motivation levels. 
Finally, before bed, I typically will browse things on my phone because I think I'm a bit addicted to my devices. I sometimes go on Twitter which I usually regret because I spend way too much time on it. I do it anyway because it's addicting, though, and I have a fear of missing out. YouTube is usually just entertaining too but the shorts are very addictive too. Then, I go to sleep once I either realize I need to or whenever I feel sufficiently sleepy. Typically, I sleep between 11 and 1 am.

My daily life involves driving to school from Sacramento around four times a week (Monday through Thursday), spending time on campus, driving home, house chores like cooking and cleaning, and spending time with my partner. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have long days at school (around 10 hours, ending at 8pm) and that takes up most of my time. I enjoy those days as I get to see my friends and peers, but I run out of energy towards the end of the day as I don't get to go home and decompress. On those days, I also make sure to pack lots of food and snacks because I get hungry every couple of hours. I would say that my mood is totally dependent on my body, as it is heavily affected by how hungry or sleepy I am. I get home quite late on those days and my partner usually makes dinner so that it's ready by the time I come home. I eat and usually spend time with my partner by watching tv, playing music together (guitar/piano/sing), and/or smoking weed. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have class in the morning and I either stay on campus or go home depending on whether I have stuff to do at home, haven't eaten, or whether I need to stay on campus and do homework. On these days I only have class in the mornings, my partner and I sometimes go for walks in the evening. These are also the days when I have time to call my family. Due to the time difference, I have to call them in the morning or the night. Calling family and friends recharges me, as I'm very close to my sisters, parents, and long-distance friends. I'm not a morning person and I find it hard to wake myself up in the mornings, but I have to get up around 8am four times a week (very early for me) due to my morning classes. In order to wake up, I always have chai in the mornings, and I never miss breakfast. I try to have eggs in the morning but if I'm feeling lazy I'll have toast with a spread or cereal. My partner and I cook most of our food for lunch and dinner, and we like to vary what we eat as we get bored of meals easily. 
Friday to Sunday are very flexible days. I have homework to do as well as life admin things like groceries and house chores, and I also like to go for drives, road trips, or meet my friends during the weekend. This is also the time I get organised for the upcoming week. I am organised and use my planner a lot, but I also struggle with motivating myself to work and end up procrastinating a lot. I know all the things I have to do (I like making lists) but I don't usually get all of it done and end up scrambling at the last minute. I like routine, but I don't like planning my day down to the hour – I prefer making lists of the things I want to accomplish in a day and try to get through those things at my own pace. I struggle with establishing a set routine for myself in the morning, but whenever I manage to do it, I always benefit from it. I am an extrovert and feel recharged when I spend time with friends and peers, but I also love staying in my house in my PJs. I have a lot of hobbies but I spend a lot more time than I would like scrolling on my phone or lounging on the couch, which I feel prevents me from pursuing hobbies of mine like singing/performing, gardening, and getting involved in activities at school.

I'd feel tired but quickly get up, get changed, and prepare to head out. I'm usually anxious, as is always whenever I'm in between classes so I get up an hour early and leave 30 minutes before, whether that makes me 20min early or not doesn't really matter since I'd rather be super early than panic being late. During class, I'd be either very interested or extremely bored (i.e., in Chem and Math I'd be scribbling down notes but in Psyc(coincidentally) I'd be playing chess or Bloons TD 6 whenever my prof starts to go on a tangent and/or is going over already learned concepts). By the end of my classes, I'd be very tired and I'll be thinking of food, either at the DC or out at local restaurants or getting boba as a treat. I'd go back and nap or binge-watch something (youtube, tv show, twitch) and talk to my friends if they are online on discord or messages. I'd continue this until dinner and probably get some homework done before I shower and feel tired enough to sleep. 

Throughout the day I'd get really annoyed at random things like people walking VERY slowly, people in lecture asking really lengthy and irrelevant questions, or just being uncomfortable after a long, sweaty walk to class. On many occasions though, I'd find myself dealing with having crohn's and the symptoms that come with it (i.e, pain and toilet) which is probably why I'm tired as it also makes me struggle to get any decent sleep. When I get the chance to sit with my thoughts I'd probably think about how I am not doing as well academically as I did in high school or how this next exam is not gonna go well. Some other thoughts are feeling out of place (constantly wonder how I even got into Davis) or just feeling like I'm not going to make it through (well, graduate yes but not with any decent GPA or experiences to put on my resume). 

Other than my thoughts some stuff does come up and give my days a little bit of sparkle. Sometimes my friends start talking about certain topics and it annoys me a little (especially a friend that goes to UC Santa Cruz). Mostly because he's a friend that doesn't really know how it is to struggle financially and it annoys me that he thinks showing himself paying off tuition with his parent's money or that his sister randomly sent him $200 is cool. Otherwise, it's nice to talk to them and watch them play video games (unless I'm home then I'd join but I currently don't have a PC at the res hall)Another frequent but not daily event would be one of my friends asking me for academic help. We've been working on our assignments together since high school and it's nice to be able to catch up and laugh while we help each other with assignments, especially because her classes are in line with mine. I've also been talking to another student at Davis and I think we're getting along nicely so that has brightened up my day whenever we get a good conversation started.  Finally, I do keep in contact with my parents but that's usually kept to when I'm going to visit home, my mother inquiring about my day, or playing the role of tech & English support.

My whole life I've been pushed in a direction to go to medical school or something in the medical field, so I've been always preparing for the NPB major here at Davis, however, I tried the classes my first quarter as a transfer in fall '22 and it really took a toll on my mental health. I pretty much felt very directionless and very scared for my future because the classes weren't sustainable and I didn't really have any other job prospects that I thought about or wanted to go into. I still have those thoughts but I'm just trying to take the steps I can right now to explore and see what fits me best. 

I decided to stay in my declared major as a cognitive science w/ emphasis in neuroscience major. This is the first quarter that I'm taking classes for it and I can say that I like them but its very different and not so much stem-like so it feels like it's too easy but I'm also not really studying as much as I should because while the material itself isn't hard its a lot of content. I'm not really sure where I'm going with this major but I'm just going with the flow. 

This quarter I only have one class period at 8am which is just on wednesdays and is honestly nice because I don't have to wake up at 6 like  I had to last quarter. I really screwed up my sleep schedule all of last year so its been really hard trying to fix it. So even with my other classes starting at 9am I still find myself going to bed late at night, like 1-2 and waking up at 7 or 7:30 if I want more sleep, but either way I feel like I don't utilize my time good enough and end up not being able to eat breakfast or just really quickly shoving a granola/belvita bar down. Which isn't really satisfying because I'm still hungry. Another thing that I discovered is that though I'm not clinically diagnosed, I feel like I have ADHD because I struggle with procrastination, frequent moving around (nothing crazy but enough to the point where I feel like I'm scratching myself too much or changing my seating position a lot), starting one thing and easily getting distracted with another task and I have to constantly check myself or ask myself ""hold on why are we here and not doing that other thing"". I also have days where I'm really productive and knock things out and then times where I just wait until the last minute and rush, or just waste my time on social media and feel guilty about it at the same time. 

I feel like I'm pretty in tune with my emotions and how I feel day to day, though I haven't really been thinking about it. BUT I will say that a little over a week ago I just started content creating and I'm mainly doing it for monetization, so theres this pressure to try and learn all these marketing strategies and how to use hooks to draw peoples attention as well as come up with new content multiple times a day so my brain feels like its on the go all the time and that I need to be distracted by something to feel present. I talked about this with my roommate the other day and after I feel better and re-evaluated how I'm going to go about content creating and maybe not posting so much. It's just very competitive on social media now so everyone is fighting to be seen. I'm not doing it for the fame aspect, in fact I get paranoid about putting my face out on the internet just because of all the creepy people so I'm not even sure if I should keep making videos. I'm just trying to grow so I can eventually get paid and I guess feel like people actually enjoy and engage with my content. I also feel guilty because I'm contributing to platforms that people are sucked into and addicted to, and I feel selfish for adding to that fire just so I can get paid. But I do want to make sure that at least my content is enjoyable but educational at the same time so I don't know. 

I have a roommate that I love, but because of her past experiences with guys, especially white guys, she seems to be very hyper aware of racism and sexism. Especially towards white people. (she's korean/white). She was talking to me about a problem she was having with her friend/classmate, and though she found out that her classmate had bipolar disorder which contributed to the problems they were having and the behaviors that were exerted to my roommate, she combined the disorder along with ""because she's white, she was acting that way because she was expressing that feeling of oppression"" or something along those lines and I don't know it just bothers me the way she talks about her views towards caucasian people. all of my childhood friends were white and I never felt any sort of oppression against them. I think I do subconsciously feel some sort of power dynamic by being asian and feeling lesser of SOME sort but I never really thought about it. I would never bring another person down just because of the color of their skin. To call someone a ""boring, white guy"" and that I should date someone else, or to call someone a sexist pig just because a guy talked to other guys and not the girls in a group(because maybe hes just more comfortable with the same gender which is pretty normal). Calling someone a misogynist and saying they hate all men and overall just being hateful. I don't know its just been frustrating. 

Because I get overwhelmed when I have more than a couple of tasks, regardless of how big or small the task is, I've learned to write everything down on a list so its easier for my brain to process it. I'm trying to learn how to set a realistic goal of tasks to finish throughout the day, and sometimes I feel accomplished but sometimes I feel like I didn't do enough or I didn't get something more important out of the way. 

I don't feel like i have the best diet right now, I try to eat vegetables when I can but sometimes I'll just wait or not utilize my time in a responsible way until I'm too hungry then I'll just put random things together and I don't really space out time to cook a proper meal. I get pretty lazy because of this and I'd like to have meals prepared for school so I don't have to go back and forth but I just don't feel as organized as I should be. 

I realized that I used to involuntarily judge and critique and assume things about other people and I also was really hard on myself before. I've learned to become more aware of how I'm feeling, why I'm feeling certain ways, and to also catch myself when I'm being unnecessarily judgemental towards others. I do a lot of mental checks. 

I surround myself with pretty good friends. I used to have a lot of one sided friendships growing up and didn't really know that I would be able to have the friends I do now. They're attentive, funny, easygoing and caring and we support each other and its really nice. I like to think that I have good intuition most times.

For every day, I have a list of assignments and any tasks I wan to get done in my phone notes app. I am very diligent about the list and view it multiple times a day. I love my psychology major classes but sometimes feel overwhelmed with all the required reading material. I find that when I read the textbook for my abnormal psychology class, I sometimes get restless and lose concentration pretty quickly, which leads me to spend excessive amounts of time on a single chapter. However reading the textbook for my developmental psychology class feels like entertainment, I find myself genuinely intrigued by what the next sentence will reveal.
Some days I will look around and feel like I am behind in comparison to my peers as I hear and see about their achievements. I go through every day hoping to find out more about the direction of my future. I don't have a plan for after graduation or even a career of interest. However, this school year I have begun to get a sense of direction by taking developmental psychology courses. As of now, I am interested in learning about infants and their perceptions. I assume that is why I enjoy the reading material for the respective course and find it more engaging than any of my other courses.
Every other day I run into my one close friend here at Davis. I do spend most of my time on my own so running into him or making plans with him is always a very enjoyable change of pace. As a minority in Davis, it is very nice to have someone from my home city and of the same cultural background to discuss the joys and hardships of college life.
When I sit in my dorm room and feel unable to do any work and any other task seems unappealing, I like to grab a sketchbook and draw or scribble on it. In all aspects of daily life, I overthink and try to perfect but lately, I have been trying to fight that with my drawings. I try to draw on impulse and not care much about messy lines, I intentionally make the drawing chaotic and messy.
I think I tend to be a little on the anxious side and tend to overthink anything and everything. I think of all possible wrong outcomes and consider the unlikely bad outcomes. 
I visit the arboretum on campus on some weekends and go for bike rides around it. This is one of my favorite things to do at Davis and it gives me great euphoria. Listening to music while at the arboretum is always a pick me up even for times when I feel homesick.
I was raised catholic, but around middle school, I stopped going to church and practicing the religion as much. However, I recently reverted to praying every night before bed and I feel that it helps me be in a constant state of calm and feel centered for the next day to come.

I feel like I should engage more with my peers in Davis, but I genuinely really enjoy the people I'm living with and I met them as friends last year. I struggle with branching out because I have a low social battery. I also keep in touch with a lot of my high school friends and we enjoy playing video games together. One of the things I struggled with since coming here was my change of identity. In high school, I identified with being a student-athlete and working out more. Since then, I have had a difficult time kind of getting myself hyped up, but when I do go I enjoy it. However, since going to college, I have also been able to explore cooking and learn how to make more complex meals. 

One thing that's impacted my perception of my daily life would probably be the fact that I'm adopted, so people's experiences with their parents are very different when we talk about it. I think that my parents and I have a relatively good relationship and communication because we've been a bit more open. I also think that the more open communication with my parents has helped me communicate emotionally better with friends and be more aware of other people's feelings as well as being more emotionally mature than others. 

In my roommate situation, there is one person that I do not like because they are rude and don't consider others (i.e cleaning and being loud when others are sleeping). This somewhat impacts my daily life because I attempt to avoid them when I can. They tend to crave male validation, so it's hard to be friends with them when they seem to compete. Although, it's weird because I am in a relationship and they are, but they compete with our mutual male friends who are also in relationships. All of this has created drama within the apartment which I think in general is not healthy.",low social battery,explore cooking,difficulty working out,adopted,good relationship with parents,communicate emotionally,inconsiderate roommate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,4,5,5,4,2,2,1,1,2,2,5,5,4,2,4,5,5,2,4,4,2,4,5,5,5,4,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,3,5,5,5,2,2,3,4,5,4,4,5,5,4,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,3,5,4,5,4,3,4,5,4,Caring,Logical,Honest,1,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,2,4,2,2,1,3,4,4,8,8,1,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,1,8,8,7,3,3,8,8,7,2,7,6,8,1,5,3,3,4,6,1,4,6,5,5,7,6,5,5,3,1,5,1,1,5,5,4,1,5,1,6,6,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,4,5,3,2,1,3,1,1,3,4,3,1,2,2,4,3,1,3,3,4,4,3,1,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,5,6,5,3,5,6,5,4,1,2,1,1,7,5,1,2,5,2,1,5,1,3,5,5,3,2,2,5,1,3,4,1,4,4,3,2,,7,,,2,,3,,3,1,1,7,7,2,Quantitative Psych,,,,3.6,16207

I transferred from a community college where they were on a semester system and I remained on top of my school work. I managed time very well and I succeeded in building relationships with professors and fellow students. Once I got to Davis, I struggled to adapt to the 10-week quarters and found it hard to stay afloat on schoolwork sometimes. I didn't let it get to me too much because I prioritized having some fun exercising or seeing people I met on the weekends. I also had such an awakening and some things that people don't talk about. I noticed really offputting things here at school. For one, the professors literally don't care about the students for the most part and many of them can't teach to save their own lives. They are hired as researchers and have no experience teaching people. I get it they try, but they cannot expect students to get things in one week. An elementary school teacher can do a better job than more than half of these professors. Another thing I noticed is the number of people who really care about school. I know there isn't a true way of measuring how much one cares about things, but when it comes to school, people just lack the drive to be true students. Time and time again I see cheating and dishonesty in the classroom that oftentimes lands them better grades than mine. I take pride in my mistakes and failures because I did so organically and without the help of online sources. Students literally show up and don't pay attention in class. Students come here with 4.0 and above GPAs and don't know common knowledge. I don't worry about other people as much because it is just a waste of energy. I believe the pandemic brought to light the oddness of people. I am very social and I enjoy being in public with people. I really struggled to make connections with fellow students for the past year and believe me I have tried. I have a very busy schedule, but I have time to play recreational soccer and go out with my girlfriend. So many attempts at friendship have sunk and the ones that I have encountered fizzled out due to a lack of communication or just a disconnection in vibe. When I moved out to Davis from Southern California, I really enjoyed being by myself in a new world. It wasn't the first time I have been far away from family for a long time as I have studied abroad in community college and for travel soccer. Calls or facetime with my family really help me get through the struggles I have faced with the reality of how people are. Not everyone is so nice and genuinely caring as I found out the hard way. There are nice people out there and people who share qualities like mine, I just have yet to find them. Mentally I am strong as I don't suffer from anything and am good about bouncing back from setbacks. I have always been like this all throughout my life, being able to be okay and lighten the mood with myself when things don't go the way I wanted. My schedule has been really busy since coming here and I really want to go to the gym more, but haven't properly made time to go. I am a bit insecure about how thin I am and have the goal to gain a few pounds. I think the exhaustion from the day gives me excuses not to go. Whenever I do go, I feel amazing and good about myself. I currently am striving to get a schedule to go to the gym more sorted out. I also find it interesting how people grow up after meeting people here at Davis. Not everyone has their upbringing bad, but the majority of people I have met have had some sort of trauma in their lives that affected the way they are. I'm not talking about trauma from a death of a loved one but from some sort of abuse either mentally or physically. Yet, they talk about it like it's nothing or its normal, which frightens me a bit when I hear it.

Because I am so tired from the lack of sleep, I often lack the energy to make myself food, resulting in me lying in bed for hours, unable to get up from how drained I am. This lack of energy also translates to schoolwork: I lack the energy and motivation to attend lectures and do my homework. Of course, as a perfectionist and eldest daughter of immigrants, I find these tasks daunting and the need to do everything perfectly, which means I get scared to begin anything I feel I can't do perfectly. Another reason I find it hard to do these basic tasks is because I feel a little lonely these days. My housemates tend to do almost everything without me, and I feel excluded. I tend to need other people to motivate me to live life to the fullest. The only thing that gets me out of bed these days is dance. I love to dance, and my dance friends make me extremely happy. On days I don't have dance, I tend to revert back to being a shell of a person.

I put on music and think about life while I walk her (things I need to do today or in the near future, write emails in my head or practice conversations I'll have later). I enjoy walking her, and I hope I will eventually be in shape from doing it everyday. I then get ready to go to work, I feel pretty neutral about it. I get sad leaving my dog, but I know she'll be there when I get back. I listen to music in the car and sing along, that usually lets me get whatever emotions I have out.

I do feel like I am the odd one out sometimes, maybe because I don't socialize as much as they do. But I am happy when they include me. I conduct my work and it can be overwhelming sometimes.

I also don't know many recipes and am too lazy to learn so its never too exciting. We'll usually throw on a show to watch while we eat and talk about our day. Sometimes I'll hang out with friends for dinner or dessert, but usually I am too tired on a weekday. I will continue watching a show/movie or going on TikTok until I fall asleep.

I think the structure of classes helps me block out chunks of time to do work, study, or prioritize my future (e.g. jobs, internships, networking). On weekends, the lack of structure is relaxing but conflicting. I usually hang out with my boyfriend, roommates, and friends. However, there's a part of me that thinks I need to prioritize my time and focus on getting experience for life outside of college. 

If I wake up and it's early in the day, my thought processes are automatic–I wake up, brush my teeth, and get ready. I don't like being late, so I try to take an earlier bus before class (e.g. if my class is at 9:30, I take the bus that arrives an hour or an hour and a half away).

I hope for connection and opportunity when I meet people. I think there's so much to learn in connecting with others and bonding over similar interests. I do get nervous in big groups though. I find that I often take a reserved approach and stay quiet, but listen in group conversations. I do prefer connecting with people one-on-one to learn about the other person, their interests, and their views. 

Being in a new environment and in college, I want to advocate for myself and push myself out of my comfort zone. Just recently, I pushed myself to attend a late club meeting on my own. I didn't recognize many people in the meeting, but it was a nice change to be somewhere different. A part of me wished I would have stayed and networked, but also a part of me knows that I wanted to go home that night because it was cold. 

I try to have a routine on the weekdays. I feel like those days are moments where my life is on pace–constant movement. The weekdays are days when things settle and there's more time to sit, relax, and be in the moment. 

Things that make me upset are when people disregard or disrespect others. At the moment, my classes have been feeling challenging but exciting. Most of my classes this quarter are more aligned with the topics that I'm interested in learning. However, one of my classes I find to be an obstacle because of its use of jargon and dense vocabulary. 

I'm usually tired every day, but mostly in the mornings. If I'm groggy or had a late night, I either drink coffee or decaf tea. I find that I go through unpleasant caffeine withdrawal from having coffee (but at times it is worth it). With my sleep schedule, I'm mainly a night owl.

I’ve started working out more at the gym or just taking walks around the neighborhood, but this can only last me so long. I feel that I am not being productive enough, but also feel that if I had more on my plate that I would be too overwhelmed, after having had so many years of five stem classes per quarter and so many hours of homework. I’m happy to have less, but wish I wasn’t as bored. On the days where I have class, it feels just like any other quarter, where I spend so much time at school and don’t get home until late. It’s nice to be interested in my classes and have something to do, but I wish I could just hang out at home on those days.

After that I have nothing until 4 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. I like to fill this time with studying and reading Manga or writing creatively. However I can also get bored during this time. I eat a wrap and maybe a bar when I get hungry. I spend this time in the library. This can be frustrating because I have a lot of reading to do and get distracted easily. After, I have my japanese cinema class until 6pm. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I have a psychology of music class at 10:30. This class had been pretty fun so far and I like to talk to the people in it. I feel pretty good after this class because it's a fun topic. After class, I head upstairs (my class is on the library) and do more studying until five when I have my Japanese Tourism and Heritage class until 7. This class is kind of draining because the teacher talks to much and it's been a bit boring. Hopefully it will get better soon.

On Friday I have no classes so it depends on me what I do. The only thing planned is to watch anime with my friends. The same as Friday goes for the entire weekend.

My first exam was this week that I put a lot of effort in studying, but at the end I feel like I did not try hard enough to do better.

I'm currently taking 5 classes this quarter to recover from last quarter gpa. Although its difficult to keep up with my classes, I believe that god is always by my side no matter what happens. I pray to the lord before going to bed as a motivation to continue the long journey.

This isn't scientific but I'm a libra haha. I am shy at first but tend to do well in social situations where I know others. I'm a bit goofy, love to make others laugh, and can be a bit introverted but I love to spend a night out drinking with my friends at the end of the week. 

My job is demanding, I worked so much overtime last summer that I am now able to work part-time with full pay while I take my lieu time back. Currently, I'm working Monday-Wednesday at my job, then spend Thursday-Sunday studying for the MCAT and working on grad school applications. I'm also on call on the weekends, available to answer questions for our staff running our research project offsite. Monday's are chill but can be a bit stressful hearing about the recap of the weekend. Tuesday's SUCK, I have two draining lab meetings that suck the life out of me. The second meeting that day is especially draining, I share my screen (on TEAMS) the entire time with our meeting agenda, but I can't see anyone else, so its a lot of awkward silence and weird pressure. Wednesdays feel better, I work on as much stuff as I can and whatever I don't get done I can delegate. I'm used to being THE point person, working overtime, and always being in the loop about everything. But now I have to focus on myself and hand off responsibilities to others which is hard. I might be a bit of a perfectionist, which I hate that's so not my vibe haha. I also had very strict parents growing up, both type A, raised by immigrant parents, enforcing strict Slavic mentalities. I'm trying to break the cycle of inter-generational trauma, which has caused a lot of tension in my household but I know it'll be worth it in the long run.

I had to fight for my title and pay in my current job. I'm only 24, one of the youngest on my team and I constantly feel like I have to prove myself. One of my bosses is great, we are very friendly and rant to each other quite a lot, but she can also be quite mean and micromanagey when she's stressed. I work 9am-5pm, technically supposed to have an hour in unpaid breaks but I inevitably work the 8h day without a break, if not more than that. Free labour! I'm a workaholic, fuelled by stress and deadlines. My workplace is also a bit negative, and I'm incredibly burnt out, so I'm currently struggling a bit with motivation and optimism. I used to be the type of person who was delusionally optimistic, to trick my unconscious mind into believing anything. Now, I'm pessimistic, waiting to put out the next fire at work. I hate it! I wish I had that spark and lust for life that I had before graduating.

I'm also perhappppsss a bit depressed, but it's winter in Canada so you can't blame me! I just work a lot and don't do a lot of things for myself so combined with a negative work situation is less than ideal.

Perhaps other relevant things about me, I'm a big mediator, an ambivert leaning more on the introverted side, and an empath. I tend to feel others' feelings and pain as if it were my own, something I used to pride myself on but I've had to suppress it a bit since my workplace can be cut and dry. Also in the coming weeks, I have a couple interviews with some potential grad school supervisors, submitting final revisions for my manuscript, and I'll be submitting my last grad school application for my dream school. There's a lot of uncertainty, will I get accepted? will this professor like me? I hate it!! Super stressful, and my imposter syndrome is rampant. Also, the last time I took the MCAT I basically failed, so I really need to study efficiently and make some progress.

Some interesting questions to ask me throughout the study: what is your stress level, are you feeling optimistic or pessimistic, was today a good or bad day, were you a good boss today, did you feel listened to/heard today? Also, don't be afraid to ask me something funny? I love a good meme, thought-provoking prompt, something to distract me from my boring stressful life!

In summary, I'm a highly stressed and anxious almost mid-20 year old feeling very lost navigating my life. I often feel like I'm not heard or taking up too much space, and don't have a good sense of a middle ground. I have lots of deadlines coming up, and its time to really focus on MCAT studying and grad school, but it's hard to separate myself from a job that consumes me. I'm learning to care for myself and bring a little joy into my life because I deserve it!? I'm scatterbrained (clearly), and learning to find my place as a silly little gen z lady in a rigid professional world. I do have plans to go out with my friends over the next few weekends, which will be interesting during this hectic month.

I get a bit sluggish after meals. Only when I'm around a bunch of white people do I feel out of place because I'm Asian. It's something I've become less self-conscious of as I've gotten older. Even though I want to become an immigration lawyer, I become very stressed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays when I have my Writing in Law class because my professor is very stringent and no-nonsense. I miss my home friends from high school often- they're very similar to me in being mostly Chinese, nerdy, musically inclined, and conservative in terms of behavior. 

I often feel lonely throughout the day, as I spend most of it alone and not talking to people. I'm an introvert and go to class by myself, eat alone, and study the best by myself. I try to get myself to go to more public places though to be more productive. When I go out to a party or something on Friday or Saturday night, I often feel guilty for spending time socializing and not buckling down. I feel guilty about a lot of things. I feel guilty for not practicing my violin more and letting my private lessons in the past go to waste. I'm proud of the fact I've started to read very frequently again as a hobby.

I try to stick to the same schedule every day, for example, by starting with a workout, going to work, and then coming home cooking dinner. From here, I have some structure for my daily life, and then I can adjust based on other commitments or needs. Like if I need to schedule an ""off day"" from working out, or if there's a work outing on a weeknight. This helps me to make time for things that are important, like work or health/fitness. If I have too many other commitments being scheduled around these, I start to feel burnout, which can break down the whole system. When this happens I simplify my schedule back down to the basics until I am consistent with those activities again, before I try to add any extra activities. 

I worry about the future. Recent events have thrown off my expectations for my future. I've had some positive changes but some others are negative. I worry about my future relationship with my siblings and parents. I also worry about the strength of my friendships and my ability to make new connections (something I have always found difficult, but after coming out of lockdown and practicing human interaction I feel a little bit better about it). I'm realizing that this paragraph is actually about relationships, but I'll add that I also worry about the next stages in my life, and how they will affect my relationships. Like, will I like my sisters-in-law? Will that affect the connection that my brothers and I have? Will I find my life partner? Will they be accepted by the other important people in my life?

I want to get connected with my roots. Growing up I always rejected my culture, but since working in community health, I've really wanted to re-enter my own community. Over the past year, I've realized a few things that may have contributed to my decision to ignore my heritage. I was bullied by a few of my peers from a very young age, who were of the same ethnicity as me. They bullied me at community gatherings (No issue now, it's been a long time, and we have mutual friends I shouldn't have let it bother me). I think I began to deliberately seek out friendships with people of other ethnicities or groups thinking I would have a better chance at being accepted. Another thing was that I felt out of place with my cousins. My younger brother, myself, and a cousin of ours are the only family members born in the states. My cousins, who spoke our language fluently, would tease me for my American accent and poor vocabulary and pronunciation, so I would refuse to participate in conversations or practice the language until a few years ago.",stability,structure,commitment,burnout,consistent,worry,strength of friendships,making new connections,rejecting my culture,get connected with my cultural roots,language practice,acceptance within groups,,,,,,,,,2,2,5,5,1,1,4,4,3,4,1,1,4,4,1,1,5,5,2,1,5,5,2,3,5,4,2,2,4,4,2,4,4,4,2,1,4,5,4,1,3,3,4,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,4,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,3,4,3,2,4,3,4,4,Sweet,Quiet,Naive,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,4,5,4,5,5,6,6,4,5,2,4,5,1,2,1,5,3,5,4,1,4,6,4,3,4,2,4,3,3,3,2,1,4,3,1,1,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,1,3,4,1,3,2,3,1,3,3,3,3,2,1,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,5,4,5,5,3,3,5,2,4,4,2,5,5,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,2,3,5,5,2,4,2,4,5,5,3,1999,7,,,2,,1,,2,1,2,5,10,,Human Development,Public Health,Psychology,,3,12454

When I feel stressed (less than three times a week), I would buy food that I crave and just enjoy the moment I have with the food item. When I am in class, I usually sit in one of the few rows in the back because I feel less ""exposed"" to people. I've been trying to sit closer to the front, but it feels intimidating to me and my face usually gets red. It could be that back in middle school and high school, I would wear hoodies in class because it felt safe and comfortable. Since it would look weird doing so in college, maybe sitting in the back is comfortable. Another reason that might contribute to why I like sitting in the back is that I am self-conscious about my hair from the back.

Last quarter, I had all morning classes, so I would come back and sit at the dining table all day doing work. It was super boring and felt like a waste of time somehow. So this quarter, I decided to take five classes and do an internship. I feel way more productive and satisfied now. I would rather take up more workload than be bored and waste my time relaxing too often. Doing so makes me feel like I have a purpose in life. I generally don't have any personal issues at home, friends, money, or school; I enjoy them all. Maybe because my life is not too crazy, I need to make my life more interesting by adding workload to myself and feeling what others feel.

I would describe myself as an introvert. Sometimes I would feel fine talking to non-awkward people, but not too talkative people. When I talk to people, I generally would like to stay away from super talkative people and people who do not initiate and reciprocate conversations.

I play video games, spend time talking to my boyfriend through discord, clean, and sometimes go to downtown for Dutch bros or other small treats for myself. It's wonderful knowing I have no obligations at that time. 

I am a homebody I greatly dislike going outside as it makes me nervous since I have social anxiety. However, going outside is a necessity so I do my best to distract myself from those feelings by listening to music or trying to admire nature around me. Most of my life is fairly uneventful as I spend most of my time at home speaking to my boyfriend, watching horror movies, or playing video games.

Monday through Friday I work as an after-school site director for an elementary school. It's about 20-25 hours a week I work this job. I enjoy the work as the kids at my school site are very kind and sometimes draw me or other little cute things. I place these drawings in a folder and hang them up on my fridge. I change them up occasionally. I enjoy talking to the kids as they inspire me to do better things with my life. They are so kind and helpful to each other (most of the time). My boss can be mean sometimes which causes me a great deal of stress since I hate disappointing others and wish to do the best I can for my job and the kids I am working with. 

I try to call my mother and father at least once a week as they always make me happy to talk to them. I am just forgetful on when to call them.

I also do studies often to help me make money on the side, but also because I greatly enjoy doing studies. They help other people and seeing results is always fairly interesting. It helps me learn about other people and gain new experiences in life I otherwise wouldn't have. It's a fun thing to do Monday through Friday as that's usually when most studies are done.  

My life generally lacks structure since I tend to go with the flow on many things in my day to day. Sometimes I have a hard time getting out of bed to do my day as I feel I have nothing to do but in reality, I do have many things to do and occupy myself with getting started on that is the hard part. 

I like writing, drawing, sewing, reading, gaming, and film (mostly horror as I'm a horror nut). I like talking to people about my or their interest's passion is fun to see on other people's faces.

I work pretty standard hours, but I just got my first salaried position and I really enjoy the work itself so I'm starting to try to be more flexible about time-- letting myself have breakfast even if I hit snooze too many times, taking a long lunch after a client was particularly abrasive, taking breaks for appointments, etc. Just as often, I find myself logging on in the late evening because I want to get the work done while I'm thinking about it and it has my interest rather than waiting for the next working day.

A lot of my life is centered around work, and it's really only a fluke that I wound up in a field I'm excited about and good at. I'm excruciatingly aware that early intimate experiences of the connection between American capitalism, housing instability, and food scarcity make concepts like ""work/life balance"" feel more abstract than the reality of high rent, higher medical bills, and a fully disabled partner, so I know I tend towards burnout and have to be very careful not to let myself cater to financial anxiety in the short-tem at the cost of long-term consequences to my physical and mental health.

On days I go to classes, I nap at every opportunity. When I don't go to classes, I sleep at around 7 am and wake up as late as 4 pm. I eat once a day around 5 pm. This is probably due to severe depression, although I refuse to take my prescribed antidepressants because I don't like how they make me feel. I try to work out twice a week, although I don't think I truly enjoy it. It's more a matter of trying to hate myself less. 
When I am awake, I spend a lot of time thinking about my mental state and life. Recurring thoughts include my troubles with interpersonal relationships, how others perceive me, and personal flaws. Interactions with other people occupy a significant portion of my worries. Just a brief encounter with someone at the door will have me anxious for hours. I often imagine scenarios in which I don't struggle as much forming and maintaining relationships with others. 
I'm in my best state at night. I often go out on walks at 3 am. I think they help my mental health, so I go even when weather conditions are not ideal.

For exmaple, most days I know the exact time I will be waking up and going to sleep to get up to 9 hours of sleep. Beyond that I plan which classes I will be working on for what days and at what times. Meal are also planned ahead of time so that I can cook for myself and clean in an efficient manner so as to not waste time. I like planning out everything because it means I can predict at the very least what my actions throughout the day will be. When I can't predict anything that will happen in a day is when I sometimes get anxiety.
Other things that I do every day is make sure to either eat a late big breakfast and skip lunch or eat a smaller breakfast so then I have space for lunch and dinner. Because I live in sacramento I get up around 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my first class so I have time to get up, change, cook, brush my teeth, and any other morning things before drving twenty minutes to school. I also tend to listen to podcasts on my drives such as the Joe Rogan Show since I enjoy how he talks to people of many beliefs and views. After I get to school I tend to park in one of the back parking lots and then bike around the UC Davis campus. I like to bring my bike because because it allows me to park in areas that always have parking plus get from class to class easier. After that I do my classes and hw for the rest of the day while mixing in hanging out with friends. I obviously prefer the hanging out part but this quarter my classes have been mostly enjoyable. Except math, but that's because my professor is possibly the worst lecturer I've had including my elementary teachers. Beyond that I have really been enjying all my classes especially since the professors seem to really enjoy they're subjects and it comes out in their teaching.

I work long days on Wednesdays, so those are typically the days each week that I feel the most overwhelmed. 
I usually am in the best mood on Fridays which is probably because I only work a half day and am looking forward to the weekend.
I am very family oriented and spending time with my family typically puts me in a really good.
I am an extrovert for the most part but there are definitely times when I enjoy having my own personal space and doing things independently. 
I have a cup of coffee every morning and definitely need this to get through the day. 
I haven't been in my current position at work for very long, so I have a strong sense of imposter syndrome and self-doubt that contributes to my feelings of stress at work. 
Sometimes I think that life feels too short to be doing the same daily routine every day (waking up, going to work, coming home, going to bed, and doing it all again the next day). For this reason, I feel the best when I am able to add some excitement/out of the ordinary activities into my week. 
Sometimes I struggle with mild symptoms of dissociation which I'm able to cope with pretty well overall. 
I have two cats and spending time with them makes me feel very happy. 
I struggle with body image concerns and think about this a lot, but I'm trying to practice self-love and body neutrality.

I get ready have breakfast, get coffee, and do homework. This brings me a sense of peace. I like the routine of getting up early and doing the same thing in the morning, such as eating the same thing, going to the same place, and doing the same tasks. As a person, I am definitely on the introverted side and prefer to spend time alone. When I am around people my social battery gets used up quicker than an outgoing person's would so I limit my social events. I am a part of a ministry team on campus because I believe in God and his son Jesus who died to save us. I chose this to be my extracurricular because my beliefs align with the people I spend time with. During the week I have bible study, a ministry meeting, and an event that are all associated with the club. I tend to feel particularly drained with the events that end late such as 8-10 pm. During the week I have classes that start between 9-11 am and end at 12 - 2 pm usually, then on Thursdays, I have lab. I find it harder to focus in lab because it lasts till 4 and is 2hrs. During the week I meet up one on one with people to talk about general things like school, faith, and life. I limit these meetings from 2-3 per week. I like these meetings because when I am focused on school I find I do not devote time to building relationships with people. During the weekend I spend time with my close friends. We go to church on Sundays, and the rest of the weekend we are either studying at coffee shops, shopping for necessities, or hanging out. These meetings are different than social outings because I do not feel tired of spending time with these people. 

My religion and my education are the main drives in my life. I tend to not self big goals for myself because in college they are always shifting based on the influx of information. I find that in college I am very particular about the people I spend time with and the things I do. I am not friends with my current roommates and do not spend unnecessary time with them, I prefer to have the room to myself actually and do not feel at ease when they are there. I find I am most productive when studying by myself somewhere not in my room. As a person I tend to identify as creative, so apart from my religion and studies I write, whether in general or poetry, I create art, whether digital or the regular hands-on kind, and things like nail art, hairstyles, fashion, or creating business ideas. Mood wise I would not say I am a cheerful person but I am not a sad or angry person either. My mood tends to stay the same but I am much more chatty with people who I have things in common with. I find it challenging in life when I think I can accomplish more than I am capable of. I also find it challenging to set myself goals that I know will benefit me but are draining with school and club activities on top. By this, I mean waking up early and exercising to then go to sleep late finishing school work which takes away from sleep. Sleep is a big thing in my life, I do not have trouble sleeping, and I tend to feel I cannot function if I do not get an adequate amount.

I then go home, back dinner, and hangout with my roommates.

I can be a little moody and snappy, mostly with my roommates. This is usually when I am tired or hungry. I like being around people like all the time.

It is hard for me to get motivated to find a new job because when I get home from work, I just feel like watching tv or going on my phone. Right now, I am struggling because my boyfriend just broke up with me, but was not really open to communicating about it. I really don't like conflict and so this has been very hard for me knowing that we did not end on the best terms. I also don't like cutting people out of my life and it's been really hard for me to cut off all contact. It makes me feel like a bad person. 

I am someone who has anxiety, but I have gotten better at managing it. What makes me nervous most, is the unknown. I like to feel like I have control. However, at the same time, I have been described as ""a very go with the flow"" type of person. I think this is in part because I would rather avoid conflict and going with the flow often achieves this. I generally get along with all types of people and I have a lot of friends whom I would consider all to be pretty close friends. I like feeling like I have a lot of friends to talk to, and each one is there for me in a different way. I'm also really close with my family and so living in a different state than them can make me sad, especially when I have just seen them and I have to go back to living my own life. 

I am a pretty optimistic person and generally in a very good mood. However, after I graduated college, I have been feeling a bit lost in what direction my life will take since it feels like I have so much freedom. I also want to feel like my career has purpose and meaning and so that is something I am searching for.

Most days, I don't know where to start which can really affect me emotionally. I am getting less sleep and feel more emotional than normal. I am just starting graduate school and it really very over-whelming, especially as a first-generation college student. My best friend from undergrad is no longer in the program, so I feel very alone and like an outcast. I feel this way more in my classes versus in the grad resource room because there some of the students in the cohort above me will talk to me more. 
    When I come home, I often feel like I am missing out on things with my roommates. However, at least once a week I cook with one of my roommates and I always feel better after that because we try something out together and talk about our days throughout the process. 
    On the weekends, I usually feel relief in going home for a little bit but also guilt that I am not with my roommates or doing homework. It is a nice drive though and it normally clears my head and I feel better afterwards.

My days tend to vary a lot when it comes to my thought processes. Some days I am extremely motivated and excited, while others no matter how hard I try to get out of bed and be productive I just can't. I don't think I am Bipolar, but more just burnt out. 

I think about my future a lot. Where I am going, how am I going to afford anything, if my parents are thinking about me, if they are proud of me, if my dog misses me, etc. It can get pretty random at times. I spend a lot of time talking to myself in my head and talking myself through things. I tend to be very emotional and can think about the things that affect me emotionally for days to months to weeks on end. 

I think a lot about the way people think of me. I am sure many people feel the same way, but I don't feel very conventional. In a lot of ways- whether it be the way I look, think, act, dress, etc. I faced a pretty big identity crisis a couple years ago, but I think I am starting to get the hang of things now and accepting of my differences. 

I tend to see my boyfriend a lot. He is a best friend to me and helps me with a lot of life stuff. He is very resourceful with cars and handy work and always helps me whenever he can. He has a very kind heart and is a genuinely good-hearted person. I think he probably understands me more than anyone else.

I have a few pretty close friends who I see throughout the week. They are good hearted people. They make me laugh a lot and I can appreciate that. I lost a good friend a few years ago. She did not pass away or anything, but did something pretty unforgivable and selfish. She never reached out after or apologized. I think about this about daily too. 

I do not have any courses in my schedule which ruin my mood. This quarter I actually love my classes and they interest me. I look forward to them.

I’m gradually losing my ability to play songs that I have written but for which I have never received any compensation, except the satisfaction of having a couple of songs publicly performed.  

One starts:

There is promise in the dawn,.,.

I tell myself that every evening just to keep going…
I think it begins with A432 hz, which is supposed to help with Parkinson’s symptoms, according to one website I saw.  Chanting “uOms” .   st A 432 hz is supposed to do that, as, but I don’t chant (but I like the disco song “Let’s All Chant!”  It picks up my spirits!)

I feel so sad about my song’s dying with me because I believe that If God gives you a gift, God is collaborating with you and through you, God’s creativity is expressed.  So I feel that I have to share my gift with others, if possible.  I feel that music can possibly change the world for the better, and that’s what I hope to do.  The guy who did the musical notation for that Hymn said it was “inspired” — he said that about only one other song that I wrote (I’ve written about 30 so far)..  

Parkinson’s is supposed to be a progressively debilitating disease, so it is difficult to maintain a positive mental attitude, especially with the various physical and mental conditions that accompany the disease (like constipation, anxiety, depression, difficulty walking the dog).  

Exercise is supposed to help alleviate some of the stress associated with the symptoms.  So I make myself exercise every day, if possible.  However, I mostly find myself going back to bed for an hour or so after breakfast— maybe because my sleep is so disturbed and disrupted by having to get up to pee several times a night, drinking water because my night guard that’s supposed to keep me from grinding my teeth creates a dry mouth condition. So it’s like a vicious cycle.  

I have to go take my RYTARY and melatonin now.  Time to “hit the sack.”

I’ll have to try to finish the survey in the morning, because “After all, tomorrow is another day!”  (Per Scarlett O’Hara of “GWTW” fame—I hear tho music as accompaniment.)

I'm not usually a morning person but I really enjoy going to the gym in the morning because it makes me feel more energized for the rest of the day and it's more than a hobby for me, so it puts me in a good mood. It also helps me feel like I have accomplished something early in the morning already. Later I go to all my classes which don't necessarily put me in a really good mood because I am the type of person who can't really sit through things well. I always want to be doing something or seeing something very interesting. In other words, I get bored easily. After my classes, I will do homework. Usually, around 3-4 PM I will get tired after doing homework for a bit so I will eat lunch and then take a nap or rest and hang out with friends for a bit or just take a break. If I have any more homework to do, I will finish it and play video games which always puts me in a good mood. It's a really good way for me to relieve stress. I usually eat dinner around 9 PM and go to bed around 11-12.

In my classes this quarter so far, I often find that I will never be friends with my classmates, due to their personalities, interests, and groups. I have never really found they I have anything in common with them. Truth be told, sometimes they irritate me. When I am at home resting or have free time, I really enjoy watching skiing/snowboarding videos because that's also a passion I have. Usually I watch anything that is outside or involves someone being active because I always want to be pushing my body and trying new things. I don't really have unwanted thoughts or behaviors and I count myself lucky because my mood doesn't change much throughout the day unless something bad happens.

Because of this, I would say that I have a fairly stable lifestyle that does not have many downs, but most certainly has its ups when I interact with friends, set aside time for hobbies I enjoy, such as games, knitting, or reading, etc. I'd say my sleep is also fairly consistent as I regularly get at least seven hours of sleep unless I have an important assignment that I've been neglecting. I cook every single day for myself and some of my housemates, which I enjoy about 90% of the time. The rest sometimes feels like a chore but does not usually bother me more than that day.

I feel two-faced a lot of the times, because I am pretty shy and reserved in class but sociable when I’m with people I’m comfortable with. I am trying to be more friendly with people that I meet in class, because I realize that my time here at college is limited. This may be the only time I am surrounded with so many people my age, so I want to give people a chance. It would be nice to make some friends outside of my usual social circle.

I hope to have a career in the medical field but I am not exactly sure what. At first I thought I wanted to be a nurse but now I’m not so sure. The future scares me but I hope to be successful. Being successful means have a great career where I can make enough money to be able to support my family and myself. Most days I just go through the motions of the day. I’m usually a very happy person but college took a toll on me. I currently don’t have any friends but I do have a boyfriend. When I’m with him I’m happy other than that I just go through the motions. I’m a first gen student so maneuvering the daily life of a college is still hard. It’s especially hard because my first year was during COVID so I didn’t get the opportunity to make friends or get the simple introductions of college life. I don’t have much of a social life because when I’m not at school or studying I’m at my job. Managing a job and school has been kind of stressful so this is why I just go through the motions on the daily basis. Also not having friends puts a damper on my social life and my every day activities. When I’m not at school or at work, I’m at home even on the weekends. I’m big on family but at the moment my mom and I aren’t on the best terms. I’m a little depressed because of the relationship I have with my mom. She means a lot to me but hasn’t been treating my boyfriend or I the best. She comments negative things about him. I sometimes get panic and anxiety attacks because of my fear of the future. If one thing that scares me more than anything it’s death and the future. I’m not big on things that I can’t control. I’m a big believer on fake it till you make it and hiding my emotions. No one really cares how you feel so why show them. I like hiding how I actually feel on a day to day bases behind a smile. I also believe that smiling makes others peoples day and even though my day is crappy there’s shouldn’t be. I am very competitive when it comes to sports and I am a huge sports fan. When a football game or baseball game, watching makes me really happy. Laughing is a coping mechanism for me. I even laugh when I’m sad or mad. Sometimes I can’t even control it.

I'm usually a very late sleeper and knock out around 2am on my good days. I feel lethargic and tired most of my day, but when I talk to people and see my friends it gives me energy! I like dressing up cute and going to school, and I like attending my lectures and learning new things. I feel like I find happiness being around people, talking, and laughing. I am a social person when people get to know me, but I can seem shy and reserved at first glance.

I feel really anxious sometimes, and I don't know why. I am super self-conscious about how I look at all times and it can really take a toll on me mentally. I am always thinking about how I am being perceived by people.  I always feel like my head is in the clouds, I am always daydreaming and I think it's because I want to be bigger and better than I currently am. I want motivation to do more with my life, to really shine, but I feel like my anxiety stops me. I desire love and attention, and I want someone to fall in love with me to be completely honest. I desire a boyfriend or girlfriend. I am happy with my academics but I also desire more opportunities to express myself creatively. I wish I had more free time to crochet, learn how to make music, and learn how to make 3D renders but school, work, family, and friends take up most of my time.

I wake up early most days and I'm always happy to take the bus to campus. I really enjoy looking out of the window and observing the people on the bus or biking around. Then when I get to campus I get tired pretty fast and sometimes I fall asleep in class. I hate when I do that. I feel uncomfortable being alone sometimes, especially when I'm eating. I never eat if I have to eat alone in public. My friend Maaya is with me a lot. We have the same career path so we get to work together a lot on passion projects outside of school. Maaya is a great friend and I'm really grateful for her. But we don't say stuff like that to each other because we aren't really mushy like that. She makes me laugh so hard. I like having classes with her. She gets me out of my shell and I'm less quiet. 

My graphic design class stresses me out a lot. I feel so stupid in that class. I feel like I'm really behind all the time and I can't do anything right. I'm bad with computers. I don't understand things I'm expected to know how to do already because everyone else does. I always leave that class feeling depressed. I have it on Mondays and Wednesdays. I write little ""good luck"" notes in my planner on those days so I don't dread those days so much. Luckily I sit next to two really nice and helpful girls who I can talk to. My professor intimidates me a lot and I don't feel like I can ask for help.

I think about my boyfriend so much. I feel like he's a big distraction from my academic life. I try to balance it but I'm really weak and I give in and hang out with him when I should do work. I never let it actually affect me academically though. I saw something online about how men make fun of women for being emotional and gossiping but they said that interpersonal relationships are often the biggest factor in determining someone's happiness in their life. That makes me feel better for sometimes prioritizing my boyfriend or my friends and social life over doing the most work possible for my classes.

I really like my classes but I've been having issues socially. I mostly only talk to a very small group of people: my boyfriend, my best friend, her roommate, and my roommate. I often feel lonely during the day because I feel like I need to branch out and talk to more people. When I see people in large groups around campus, it makes me sad because I'm socially anxious, and I feel like I don't have the capabilities to make friends out of my comfort zone. Whenever I'm with people I don't know well, such as on the weekends, I typically feel uncomfortable and want to go back to my room so I can isolate myself.

I am also very sensitive to sensory stimuli. I am able to focus well when I am in the right environment, but if I am studying in a loud and busy area, I cannot get anything done because the sounds overwhelm me. Even when I'm in a room and two of my friends are talking at the same time, I get frustrated with them. I'm also a very sensitive person and cry frequently when things affect me emotionally. I feel like I am very empathetic, so when something bad happens to my friend, I get almost as distressed as they are.

Right now, I am not liking my physiology course because the professor doesn't explain the concepts in a way that I understand. My discussion classes also feel a bit unnecessary, so I haven't really been enjoying those either. My classes in general just feel like more of a drag than they did before. I can't tell why, because they're actually easier than my classes last quarter. Everyone around me seems to be very sad too and it's affecting how I feel about my life.

Though I am relatively new to college, I am already worrying about getting into graduate school, as I know it can be very competitive. I feel like I have to get the perfect grades and do as much as I possibly can so I am a good candidate. I'm starting two jobs currently and I'm not sure how I'll be able to balance everything. I'm waiting it out to see if I need to quit one of them, but I know I will also feel guilty if I do quit, even if it's for the sake of my mental health. I worked so hard for both of the positions and my friends and family are very proud of my achievements so early into my college career, so I don't want to let them down.",friends,overwhelmed,sad,isolate,accomplishments,sensitive,discussion classes,jobs,focus,mental health,balance,right environment,perfect,sensory stimuli,cry frequently,frustrated,uncomfortable,guilty,boyfriend,,1,2,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,3,2,1,5,4,1,1,5,5,1,1,4,3,3,4,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,4,4,1,2,5,5,1,2,3,3,2,3,5,5,1,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,5,5,2,5,5,empathetic,responsible,perceptive,2,1,2,3,1,3,4,3,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,8,2,8,3,8,8,6,4,8,3,3,5,6,1,5,8,7,8,7,6,5,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,5,2,5,1,2,1,5,4,1,4,2,5,2,2,6,1,6,4,6,5,5,1,4,2,2,4,3,4,3,2,6,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,4,2,1,5,5,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,2,3,3,4,1,3,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,5,4,5,2,5,5,7,5,6,6,6,3,4,7,7,1,1,1,2,6,3,5,3,5,3,3,4,5,4,3,5,5,3,3,5,4,5,4,1,5,5,5,3,2004,1,,,2,,3,,0,1,1,6,7,1,Psychology,,Human Development,Education,4,16072

One of my current classes is really interesting to me, and I really like it. The other ones, I am still interested in, but less so. I work at the Coffee House,  usually around 14 hours per week, in a front of the house position. I'm also a member of the Mental Health Initiative, and I volunteer at a psychology lab somewhat informally. I just started volunteering as a staff member for one of the ASUCD Senators. 
This quarter, I've been spending most of the day on campus attending classes, working, and studying. I like being busy, but at the beginning of the quarter, I was already feeling kind of burned out. I do tend to struggle with burnout, even though I usually still feel like I'm not doing enough. I think I definitely do struggle with toxic productivity, feeling like I need to be doing something productive at all times. I still feel internal pressure to get involved in more activities, too, even though if I think about it, I'm doing plenty of things. But I feel like I should apply for more jobs, internships, research positions, volunteer positions, etc. I tend to compare how busy I am with other people, which I think is problematic. And when I have a lot of free time, I don't know what to do with it. I struggle to let myself take breaks and relax.
I used to do all the reading for my classes, but it's week 3, and I've already stopped doing some of it. I feel less motivated to do things, in general, if I don't have to.
I do really love my high school friends, and I usually have fun hanging out with them. I try to make time to hang out with my friends, but it can be hard to coordinate schedules, and I think I see them less this year than I used to before. It seems like we're all busier. I do feel lonely sometimes, especially when I spend large chunks of time on my own. I also tend to worry about whether my friends actually like me, especially because it feels like I'm the one initiating plans a lot of the time. But if I spend too much time alone, I will get sad and lonely, and sometimes that's a problem on the weekends. I also miss my family. I don't live that far away from home, so I can go home on the weekends, but I am close with them, and it's kind of hard living up in Davis without them. Especially after winter break, I got really used to being able to talk to them whenever and spending a lot of time with them. I find myself still missing winter break a lot because it was a really good time for me when I got to truly relax, have fun, and hang out with my high school friends, who I have trouble keeping in contact with now. 
I live with 3 other people in an apartment. Lately, I haven't been talking with them very much. I was friends with two of them before we decided to live together and honestly, I don't think I'm very good at living with other people. I would have preferred to have my own room, but my parents pay for my rent, and I didn't want to make them pay more, so I tried to make my rent as cheap as I could. I feel resentment towards my roommates sometimes. I don't think it's really justified, and it's usually about little things. I don't really bring it up. I've kind of just been keeping to myself at the apartment. My roommates are usually busy with their own things anyway. But I think living together has actually made our relationships somewhat worse. I was afraid of this last year, actually. Last year, when I was a freshman, I didn't talk much with my roommate either (a different person), and I felt similar feelings toward her. So maybe I'm just not very good at living with other people. I also feel like a bad roommate sometimes for not doing enough in terms of cleaning & stuff.
I think I'm an insecure person, and I worry considerably about what other people think about me. Oftentimes, I feel like I'm not funny or witty enough for other people to like me. I also feel insecure about my appearance sometimes. I think I'm also a pretty anxious person. I worry about a lot of things, and I think I have for a while. Oftentimes, I think that the things I worry about aren't even worth worrying about, but I can't stop worrying about them anyway. Like, they don't matter, but it feels like I need to be worrying about something. I used to worry a lot about food and exercise, and I felt like I may have had orthorexia, but I never talked about it with anyone, and it's been getting better lately. But I think that's because my anxiety has just shifted to worrying about other things. I wonder sometimes if I have an anxiety disorder, but I've never actually been diagnosed with a mental illness. I don't think it looks like it on the outside. I think I function well enough. I definitely do care about my grades, and I do enough to get As in my classes. But internally, I do worry a lot. I've also wondered if I have depression, but again, I haven't really seen anyone about that. I do feel tired a lot and not very motivated, but it's kind of normal for me. I think it gets worse when I'm by myself. I tend to feel a lot happier when I'm with other people and somewhat forget about my worries. It's a bit ironic because I'm participating in mental health advocacy and such, but I'm still not really taking care of or addressing my own mental health issues. So I feel like a hypocrite sometimes.
I also feel insecure because I haven't really decided on what career I want after college, and I hate when people ask me what I want to do. It always feels bad when I have to say that I don't really know yet, especially when other people already do know. I feel like I have a lot of interests, and it's hard for me to pick a certain job. It also feels overwhelming that there are so many options. And I want a job that's somewhat prestigious and pays decently. Ideally, something that matters to me as well. 
I think work is kind of draining for me. I do enjoy working because I like making money, and I want to be more self-sufficient. I like most of my co-workers, and I don't mind the work I do. It's still tiring, though, and I think it contributes to burnout sometimes. As I said, I like my co-workers, and I would like to get closer to some of them, but it's hard to cross over to being actual friends instead of co-workers. Also, since it's a new quarter, scheduling is different, and I don't get to see some of my favorite co-workers from last quarter, so that made me sad.
I think I just feel tired a lot in my everyday life, maybe because I'm trying to do too much. I feel anxious a lot too, often about inconsequential things. I feel lacking in motivation to accomplish my tasks, but I usually get the things done that I need to do. I don't really confide much in other people about this stuff. Normally I just talk about surface-level things. Sometimes I write in my journal when I feel like I have a lot to get off my chest but don't want to say it to other people. I listen to music a lot, which is comforting and motivating for me. Music is important to me.

I wake up everyday around 8-9. I dislike mornings and the last thing I want to do is talk to someone right when I wake up. To avoid this, I only wake up/get out of bed right before I need to go to class/work. I have this down to a tee since I do the same thing every day so I don't have to worry about missing the bus. On days in which I have class/work later in the day, I get out of bed at 9 otherwise I will fine like a bum and it ruins my whole day energy-wise. Although I am almost always low energy. I only use large amounts of energy when I really have to. 

I then take the bus to work/class. My response to class is typically the same in all cases. I don't care to be there. If there is a remote option then I will stay or do whatever I wish and watch the recording later. In general, I dislike being is places that are largely populated as it tires me out to be there. Classes are not an exception to that attitude. People are just a hassle to deal with. They are unpredictable and problematic. They throw a wrench in my plans and it upsets me. I am not totally attentive during class. I get disinterested if the speaker is too slow and if I feel like it is a waste of time being there. Ever since quarantine, that feeling has become more prevalent since I've gotten used to watching lectures on 2x speed. 

I have work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I'm always tired after work. It helps when I have a friend there with me for a majority of the time. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, in addition to class, I go bowling between classes. I really enjoy those times since I feel like I don't get much free time to myself. When I'm bowling I typically become very focused on trying to get better and score as high as I can even if I am playing by myself. 

After I get home from school, I take an hour break watching YouTube or playing mobile games then I do homework which I usually do till 9 or 10. At that point, my brain cannot function so I say 10 is the point at which ""productive hours"" end. After productive hours, I get ready for bed. This is my favorite part of the day. Every other part of the day is subject to change depending on circumstances but my nightly routine is always the same. It is extremely relaxing for me. That is the time I decompress from the day.

Anxiety sources include medical school application, work stress, etc. I'm a very anxious person, so these thoughts keep me up at night. When I wake up, I always tell myself that I'm going to take a nap during lunch break after the morning shift, but I never end up doing this because I call my boyfriend or talk to my coworkers or go to Starbucks for coffee.

I work at a pediatrics clinic as a scribe - my mood is often ruined by various factors, most common ones being: long visits due to anxious parents (they will have a list of 20 questions such as ""my baby burped once 2 weeks ago. is this normal?"" and take an extra 20+ min when we only allocate 15-30 min per patient), complicated patients for example discussing mental health (these take 80 min and puts us very behind schedule), and getting let out late due to a busy schedule (per contract, we're supposed to be let out for lunch by 1:25 PM but it's very awkward to ask the doctor this in the middle of the visit so nobody ever does it).

Bay Area traffic is awful, so I'm always irritated by this. It takes 50 min to get home usually. Having graduated from Davis, I've been living at home, and it's very isolating not seeing friends anymore. I definitely get lonely at night since I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't enjoy going to work because it's minimum wage and they overwork us, but I love talking to my coworkers and getting some human interaction.

I get between 5 and 8 hours of sleep a night. Most of my day is sedentary - I’m usually employed but not working right now due to a rib injury. My parents are mostly supporting me, and I spend the vast majority of my time alone because of it - I have existing mental health issues that it exacerbates, but I’m not really on great terms with my roommate (previous bad experiences, social anxiety, and deep dislike of change) and the rest of my friends are employed or in school, so it can’t be helped. It does mess with my head though - I have enough self-worth issues without adding “failure to launch” lol. I’m working on getting the injury fixed (to loop back around to the point), which will likely involve a bunch of doctors appointments over the next few weeks.

Most of my day is alternating between writing, drawing, gaming, and taking online skill courses. Usually I’ll watch streams or listen to music in the background (I’m like….99.99% sure I have ADHD, and need 100% of my brain occupied at all times or I will actually combust), but sometimes I’ll be on a phone call with one of my parents or something. Most of my interaction with others comes via text, so it gets pretty lonely. Talking to someone just hits different. I do have a cat though! Her name is Molly, sometimes I take her out on walks around our apartment complex, and I talk to her like she understands me. Sometimes I swear she does lol. I also don’t usually cook - it takes a loooooot of energy for me, so I rely on frozen stuff, take out, and easy one-pot meals with pasta or rice. I feel better physically if I’m eating something I’ve made (it feels healthier if that makes sense?), but I already have issues with eating enough so I’m very much in “all calories are good calories” mode.

My one consistent weekly obligation is therapy! Every Friday afternoon, I have a zoom call with my therapist. Depending on what we talk about, my emotional state tends to vary. Im usually more calm before I go in, then have a few hours of being emotional afterwards while I process whatever we dug up. It doesn’t usually last more than a day or so absent other triggering situations. 

When I am able to be more social, either because my friends are free or because I’m able to branch out through my anxiety, my mood improves. I actually enjoy being around people - like 90% of the ones I’ve run into suck though, hence the social anxiety. The social stuff usually happens on weekends and tends to involve either hanging out at their apartment or going bar hopping through Sacramento.

Sorry if this is disorganized! My thought patterns can get hectic and it’s really hard to edit on mobile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8885

I work as a teacher in the  mornings, Tuesday through Friday, and go to college immediately after in the afternoon. Almost every day, I am stressing about whether or not I can teach effectively to the students under my care. I am always excited to teach, but am afraid that I may be a bad teacher on days, which is never good. After teaching, I have a five hour lab on Monday and Wednesday, which is very exhausting. I do enjoy it, and look forward to it every week, but I leave very tired, and still have to finish my commute back to my hometown outside of Davis. Tuesday and Thursday I have a bio and history class, both of which are very fun and interesting to learn about. My bio class has a fun professor, and the history class has classroom engagement, which is something that I really enjoy. It is hard for me to make friends in college, so classes like this history class help me to talk to others.
Ultimately, I am very stressed as I want to get into medical school, and am looking at the avenues alone. I feel pressure from my family to do well and succeed all the way to top. This makes it very stressful during schools and medical school searching, as I feel that I have so many people that expect me to do well because I am the ""smart one"". When getting home, I enjoy playing video games to help relax me from the stress. It also helps me to connect with my brother, who is stationed in Japan currently. Aside from this and college classes, I have little interaction with people outside of my immediate family.
Whenever I do get stressed, especially during homework or study sessions, I will resign to my bed and watch Youtube videos. This helps me to see someone who has succeeded or is doing something fun, and tends to cheer me up. I have always found that it makes me very happy to watch and help someone achieve their goals. Usually, I prioritize others over myself, and will help even at the cost of my own grades.

With my classes and the three clubs I'm helping to run, plus some extra clubs/socials on the side, I feel like I'm a lot more drained and occupied than I'm usually comfortable with. I've been trying to better myself for the past couple of years due to issues I had with mental health I had in high school (nothing extreme or something to be worried about, it's just an experience I had back then). Because of that, I've been working on bringing myself to engage more in the world/people around me and have a more optimistic attitude. So even though I tend to complain about how my life is busier than I want it to be and I'm out of my comfort zone a lot, I do think that it's something I want to continue with and generally make me a better person. On Fridays, the tea club I'm vice president of meet up. Therefore, throughout the week, I'll probably be stressing about it, from bringing teas/food, making sure we have a place to meet up, and how many people will show up. But after the club, I end up feeling pretty fulfilled and happy meeting everyone who showed up and talking to them. This is a cycle I tend to go through a lot: worrying about something for what I think is way longer than necessary, only to feel pretty satisfied once the actual thing comes and then passes. 

On a more general topic, I'm a Filipino third-year psychology major. I can't say being Filipino has really affected my daily life in any largely impactful way, but I do feel the slightest bit of pressure every once in awhile. I grew up in a very social and family-oriented environment, and I feel like I am very much neither. Especially in social settings, I feel like there's this expectation to be social and upbeat, since that's the stereotypical personality of someone who's Filipino, so that tends to be on my mind. 

I also tend to ramble and get very lost in tangents. Case above. Don't ask me too many things about my identity as Filipino, because I'll probably just end up saying the same things over and over.

Going to the gym was a way to reclaim my confidence, which is good and all, but inside I still feel that feeling of resentment of myself and how I considered myself lame all these years.

I'm always thinking about relationships. I always wondered if I would ever get into a relationship. I always think about how people back then got into a relationship, but it just seems so much harder. I would want to be in a relationship, but it always scared me. I'm afraid of the repercussions if something were to happen and we wouldn't be friends anymore. Recently, my housemate is dating another housemate within the same apartment, and it triggered these thoughts about relationships that I don't really know how to navigate.

I have this desire to go to medical school, but the road to reaching it seems very hard. One of the classes I have to take is organic chemistry, and the class stresses me out very much. It's the second quarter of the organic chemistry series, and I am not very confident about it because the content relies on things we learn from the first quarter. It stresses me out because I didn't do that well in the first quarter of organic chemistry, so it is pretty stressful.

I always think about cooking food. Last quarter was very stressful, considering that I had a lot of extracurricular activities to do on top of taking 4 STEM classes. Cooking food is an outlet for me to destress from my responsibilities and I found a lot of joy in it. It's always a good opportunity to cook with my housemates and my friends and just enjoy each others' company.

I don't want to say that I am a people pleaser, but I do try my best to get along with the people that I interact with. I think I am the type to want to make small talk with people even if I meet them for the first time. I think I'm like this because I don't want to be perceived as an antisocial person and that I want others to perceive me as someone who can hold a conversation. I think that is something that I definitely value when I talk to another person.

I also feel like I am barely learning anything. I take so much notes but none of it is stuff im actually learning.

I am a first-generation college student, there is so much pressure on me to be amazing in life. Not even by my parents, but by myself too. I have two younger brothers and I want to be a role model. I want to be successful in life so I could help my parents out. Sometimes I get a wave of anxiety or sadness at night because I have a fear of being a failure.

I honestly started giving up so easy in college. Although I do all my work and stuff. It is very tempting for me to drop classes when I see there's an assignment that will be too hard for me to complete.

In college, the friends I have made come from a very different background than me. Even searching for apartments for next year is a crazy experience because I come from a family that isnt as fortunate money wise. However, my friends are different and theyre parents make way more money than mine. At one point they were looking at apartments way above my budget. I felt stressed. How were my parents going to afford that? I ended up telling them I found a cheaper apartment and I would be living there, with random roommates if they ended up choosing the nicer apartment (if my parents had the money I would).

The reality is that my alarm goes off at 7am every day and I immediately hit snooze and sleep in until I absolutely have to start work at 9am. I really just struggle with having a consistent routine throughout the day and it's something that I want and I don't know why I can't stick to one. I think I'd feel so much more like a functioning human being if I knew I could wake up at the same time every day and go to bed at the same time and have some consistency on a day to day basis. And I constantly fall into the trap of ""I'll be better tomorrow"" ""I'll go to bed on time tonight and then tomorrow will be perfect"" and then it's not perfect, or at least it doesn't go according to how I wanted it to go. 

I am grateful that I have a job that I like doing every day that's not super high stress, but right now I'm in between projects so I don't feel like I'm actually doing that much during the workday outside of doing more learning/development/reading things rather than actual writing work or being in meetings. I also love the flexibility of working from home - I think I'd start losing my mind a bit if I had to go into the office every day - but I also feel like I don't have close relationships with anyone at work that I could see in person. A lot of my coworkers are older and the ones who are my age are not in my area so I don't see them often, and every time I go into the office I just go into a quiet corner by myself because I don't know anyone to sit near and I envy the people who have the assigned desks because they worked at the company prior to remote work and know people that they interact with. It's weird to be in this generation of adults who graduated during COVID and don't have any in-office experience with work, I feel like it's had a lasting effect on my social life.

Typically on Monday’s are my most sluggish feeling days. After a fun exciting weekend, I go back to school and start with my extra curricular activities. My Tuesdays and Thursdays are my longest days of the week. I start it off with going to the gym. Going to the gym, really gives me the boost of energy I need for my morning and the rest of the day. I then proceed to soccer practice. This is one of my favorite times of the day because I get to see all my friends and mess around a bit before practice. Soccer is one of my passions and being able to share that with my teammates that are also my best friends is amazing. After Monday and Tuesday the week repeats its self. 

Overall, I am typically an energetic person, but I do have my off days where I just want to lounge around and be by myself. Having that balance of being energetic and that time off to re-charge is important to me on my day to day.

I work 4 days out of the week and usually whenever there's a school break I try and work more hours instead of enjoying my break.

Therefore, I feel that I am simply just getting by. I am excited to finally be done with my BA and do not think I will be continuing any further education down the road. School has never really been appealing to me but have made it this far because I thought the knowledge would be useful and it seemed like an easy career path. 
Outside of school and work, I enjoy going on hikes, cooking, exploring new restaurants and tending to my aquatic friends.

No matter what has happened or is happening seems to affect me right after I wake up. If I'm in a bad or frustrated mood the night before, going to sleep really helps me just look past that and start the day afresh. Most days I feel good when I'm surrounded by my friends at Davis. I have realized that I'm a social person and I need people around me to feel good. Whenever I'm around some specific people it just relaxes my mind like I'm recharging, but that's only with my few closest friends. 

But there are days when it all starts off bad and the day just goes downhill. I feel like that is usually a pointer to the fact that I'm either running out of my social battery or I'm burnt out. On those days, no matter who I'm around I seem to be quiet and irritable. But it only lasts 1-2 days maximum and after that I feel alive with energy again. So I guess it's my minds way of shutting down, giving me a break, and rebooting the system.

I like agreeing to things in the moment and typically do no regret my in the moment agreements (ie agreeing to go out somewhere). But when I agree to do something and have time to think about it, I end up dreading it and regretting agreeing to it in the first place and would rather stay at home.
Most days I have little to no appetite to eat, but following the periods of low appetite which lasts days to weeks, I have days where I crave various foods. During those days, I don't eat because I feel hungrier but because I can't get enough of the flavor of the foods I crave.
I'm not super outgoing, but I can still have a decent conversation with most strangers. If everyone is new and getting to know each other, I do well. But when I'm meeting a group of people who already know each other, I shut down and don't talk and pretend to be engaged by listening. I think I think its embarrassing to ask get to know you questions that everyone else knows the answer to. I would never think its embarrassing if someone else is new to my group, the mindset only applies to me.
I prefer hanging out with one or two people at a time because it feels like my presence matters more if there are fewer people. If I can disappear in a crowd/large group of friends, I wouldn't make an effort to stand out.
I procrastinate a lot. I end up getting my work done eventually though. This is actually an attempt at procrastinating other things I need to get done. I tend to push my work till late at night and sometimes it gets too late. In those cases, I push them off till the next day.
I have moments where I want to grind out my tasks and be productive. I don't know when it happens or what I do to encourage it from happening. I think its usually at night before things are due or if it a scheduled task with someone else like a group project.

On my work days (currently Wednesday through Friday), I wake up exactly at 6:00AM. My first thought is almost always to tell myself to get up right away so I don't run the risk of falling back asleep and being late for work. The first ten steps are usually the most difficult since I'm still getting adjusted to standing up after abruptly forcing myself to do so. Because of that, my mood is pretty low since I'd rather be in bed getting a full eight hours of sleep. Once I get up and moving, my mood slowly begins to reach a neutral baseline where I don't feel anything. My mind is too slow to think of anything or feel any type of way about anything. Once I get to work at 7:00AM, it takes me about 30 minutes to fully wake up. Socializing with my coworkers also helps because they are all very positive and supportive. I work at a farm where we do a lot of manual labor, so we have a strong sense of community since we work very hard alongside one another. The day drags on usually until the clock strikes 3:45PM and I can go home.

Once I arrive at home, I feel a bit of relief. I also tend to feel a little bit upset upon my arrival because I know a good portion of my day will be spent in the dark since the sun sets not long after I arrive. Especially on days I have work the next morning, it feels like the rest of the evening is just a transition into the next workday, which is a bleak way of looking at it I suppose. I socialize with my roommates a bit throughout the evening. We usually catch up on our days and tend to gossip about the small dramas going on in our individual lives. It makes me happy to have fun discourse about that kind of stuff (possibly because it makes me feel like part of a community). I also have a cat who always makes my day a little bit brighter.

On non-work days, I have usually been oversleeping a bit. I wake up no later than 10:00AM though, and get my day started with breakfast. If I hadn't already made a to-do list for the day, I'll do that pretty early on as well (which subsequently reminds me to take my adderall). I almost always finish everything by 2:00PM, with the exception of my laundry and my homework. I tend to procrastinate on those two tasks more than any others. I think it's because they are the most time consuming and provide the least amount of instant satisfaction compared to other things I can be doing. 

I feel happier during the week when I have plans for my days off. It gives me something to look forward to. 

After this Friday, I will have a week off from work and be starting a new job on Monday, February 6th. I'm excited for that, but a bit nervous because I will be working full time Monday through Thursday from 6:00AM to 5:00PM. I will wake up before the sun rises, and arrive home just before the sun sets. I am afraid that will negatively impact my mood. I am looking forward to the increased income though, which I will be using to save for college.",working,risk,difficult,low,neutral,socializing,community,gossip,happy,discourse,to-do list,adderall,procrastinate,plans,,,,,,,5,4,1,1,5,5,1,3,4,2,2,2,4,5,3,5,4,3,5,5,4,4,3,5,5,5,1,1,4,3,3,4,3,4,2,5,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,5,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,1,5,5,2,2,5,3,1,1,3,1,3,2,4,4,5,4,4,4,honesty,humor,cunning,2,4,2,4,3,2,1,2,1,4,1,3,2,2,2,3,4,2,2,1,4,2,8,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,4,4,3,8,3,3,3,8,3,6,5,4,8,8,8,8,2,8,6,8,8,5,3,2,6,2,2,5,3,1,7,7,2,6,5,1,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,6,6,5,5,4,5,5,5,3,5,1,1,4,2,5,6,6,6,5,2,2,5,5,4,2,1,2,4,1,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,4,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,4,4,2,6,7,5,2,4,5,3,5,5,6,2,2,3,3,1,2,3,5,3,2,4,4,1,4,1,1,2,5,5,1,1,5,1,1,5,3,5,5,1,5,2000,1,,,2,,1,,2,2,1,3,1,4,Linguistics,,,,3.5,10208

I have a lecture Mon. and Wed., but sometimes I don't feel like going to them because the slides are posted and this is just a GE class for me. I think with how much I have on my plate is the reason why I'm not motivated to go to that class. I do have a class on Tues where attendance is mandatory, so I make sure to go to that. 
After my morning class, I'll usually come back home where I feel most comfortable to do work, eat some food, and relax. I'm sure I feel more relaxed at home because this is where I live, I have access to all my things here, and I have a desk set up that I highly prefer over setting up in the library. Comfortability is everything to me when I study and do homework. 
Then after doing homework and getting food, that usually takes me to my now daily afternoon nap that I always take before work. I am a big napper; sometimes I find that I cannot function without a nap, and I am not entirely sure why that is the case, maybe it is because I don't get enough sleep at night, or it has just become so much of a routine that breaking it will send me into ""withdrawals"" so to speak.
After my nap, I go to work where I work with children with autism. That could also be a reason for my naps, because I deal with kids for my job which can be a big handful. My clients are pretty obedient and not very troublesome for the most part. I am always not excited to go to my Wed client because the session is for 3 hours (my other ones are 1.5-2.5 hours), he lives all the way in Elk Grove, and he is super energetic, talkative, does not always hear or understand me, and does not appear to be progressing much in some of his programs. 
After work, I just go home and go back to doing homework usually. Tues and Thurs I have a lecture that I also do not attend, but may start to because not doing so has really made me more busy with homework. I am honestly getting so exhausted already from my workload this quarter just from my two psych classes. There are just lots of assignments for both classes which means that there are multiple ways to earn (but also potentially lose) points. And I have always been a diligent and studious student that always pushes myself to get work done on time. I think that is why I am exhausting myself in the sense that I need to get everything done by the deadline and I think I have turned it into a philosophy that late work or sloppy homework is a bigger deal than it is. I do work really hard though, and I do have the GPA and consistently good grades to back it up, but it is really draining on me. 
Sometime I hang out at my frat that I'm in which is always a good stress reliever and mood booster. As long as I do not have homework due that night that I need to come back home to do, I always enjoy my time there and don't rush anything. I love hanging out with my big who truly has become like another big brother to me and all the other guys are so accepting and inclusive. I do feel a disconnect sometimes though because it is not very often that I show up (I wish I could've lived in our chapter house), and also because I am gay, so I do not relate to the same things as them, but often I am able to conversate with them about something. It is not hard for me to hang out with them most of the time and joke around with them. I do feel a bit of a pressure to be around more often because I want to connect more with them, but also I think my activity level there could be a contingency when I plan to run for cabinet for next year--another thing on my plate.
I also am a part of a research lab as a research assistant which is also a big commitment (expecting 10 hours per week). It is hard to update my availability this quarter for that since I am busy with my other work and just everything else I have going on. Since I am a part of running studies, though, it is easy to get my hours up since a single visit is half of my required work time for the week. I am excited to finally start that after a quarter of training, but I hope I have sufficient time for it. 
I do also like to go out on weekends. I try my best to grind out homework during the day so that I can go out at night with less on my mind. I made it my goal to have more fun this quarter, so I hope I can stay on top of everything. When I don't stay on top of it, though, that's when it starts to exhaust me and make me feel depressed because I feel trapped and lonely when I feel like I have no choice but to finish all my work.

I don't socialize a lot in the mornings, as I tend to be in large lecture classes or in my apartment, where my roommates are late-night people and are usually not awake. I am productive as possible before lunch, though if I'm working for long periods of time my mind often wanders to the podcasts I've been listening to or books I've been reading or other more interesting topics. After lunch I generally get in a few more hours of productivity, but often have trouble concentrating after 4 or 5 pm, either out of habit or because I've already been awake and working for hours. 
On campus, I still spend a lot of time alone during the week because I tend to be more productive that way, and don't mind it. I enjoy and am engaged with most of my lectures, as being in a setting where other people are focused tends to help me focus. The possible exception is my 6pm to 8pm lecture, which is after I would rather not be thinking, and I'm often a little more distracted, though somehow being in a lecture hall still lets me focus to some degree. 
I also do archery in the evenings 2 days a week, and in the mornings on the weekend. The board for archery is fairly close knit, and I often come away from practice feeling physically and socially energized - despite generally being introverted I'm comfortable enough around most of those people that the chance to socialize and goof around is welcome. 
I mentioned I'm fairly introverted - being out of my apartment and active and socializing for longer than I'm used to (say more than 8 or so hours) tends to make me mentally and physically tired.

Currently, my schedule involves going to clinical on Monday and Tuesday for 12 hours. I'm off on Wednesdays and I have my theory classes on Thursday and Friday for about 6-7 hours. I hate going to clinical for 12 hours. It's really tiring and I have no energy when I get home. It's really annoying getting up early as well. It's a good thing my instructor is pretty great though. She's nice and teaches us well. She even lets us go early sometimes. I'm not close with my peers though. I'm more of a loner and I don't make friends easily so that's why. However, I don't mind. I have a partner that I talk to on a daily basis so I don't get lonely. I enjoy having Wednesdays off. I use it to relax and study a bit for my theory classes the following days. On Thursday, I have my Medical-Surgical class. I'm currently doing well in it. The instructor is good but is a bit tough. I have that class again on Friday along with Pharmacology. I'm not doing well in that class at the moment. The instructor is pretty bad at teaching and isn't communicating with us well so that's hurting my grade. I need to study more to bring up my grade in that class. 

My weekdays are pretty uneventful. My routine mostly consists of playing video games, watching youtube, and listening to music. I also get in a bit of studying. I like playing RPG games. Right now, I'm playing a game called Fear & Hunger 2: Termina. It's a really fun and unique experience. I watch youtube videos of that game as well. I like listening to rock music. My favorite bands include Nirvana, Foo Fighters, etc. I really don't like the food at my house so I constantly get takeways from nearby restaurants.

I usually have a mid-day lull, around 3-5 ish where I feel bored. When I feel like this I usually go the gym or a coffee shop downtown, to kill time before my next class.

I am also a transracial Asian adoptee with a bilateral cleft lip. On a daily basis, as an Asian-American full-time student, I’m honestly on autopilot for most of the week until the weekend. I guess you could say that it’s a sort of coping mechanism for me because sometimes the stress/fear of not doing well, missing a deadline, failing all of my classes, and the financial burden of attending UC Davis is too overwhelming and my mind looks for some kind of escape. I also have a hard time focusing on my professors for my lectures, like there’s so many thoughts/daydreams that distract me. If I had to put my actions into thoughts I’d say that my thoughts are to wake up, brush my teeth, get ready for classes, motivate(low key force) myself to eat, go to class, listen during lectures/participate during discussions, eat dinner, brush my teeth/wash my face, get ready for bed, and go to sleep. Then my thoughts become more sporadic and spontaneous during the weekends. 

As a young Asian-American woman, I have come to grow wary of my surroundings and slightly fearful of white people (especially men). These feelings have manifested since I started high school, when I started to realize I was being exposed to gender and racial stereotypes/hate crimes from my peers and strangers. Two of the most prevalent events happened in Ireland and Vancouver, where I was spat on by white teenage boys for being Asian, and verbally harassed with my sibling by a homeless man- also for being Asian- in Vancouver. I used to feel great anxiety back in high school just for being Asian and I had no one else to really talk to because the student/general population was mainly white or Latinx. My anxiety has gotten slightly better since coming to Davis as there’s a larger Asian-American & Pacific Islander population. 

In terms of beliefs, I’d say that it mainly centers around freedom and rights for women, women of color, people of color, and people in the LGBTQA+ community. I have these beliefs because I identify with all of these and I have watched and lived through the many problems and horrible stereotypes that have been tied to these identities. In the recent years, I have started to speak out more about women’s rights to their own bodies. I find it despicable that there’s people who lack uteruses that are trying to govern my body and it’s functions, and am pretty much being told that my only purpose is to become an incubator. Every time I hear someone or find out that someone in my social circle expresses these views, I feel so disgusted and frustrated. 

In terms of desires, I can only focus on the present and close future at the moment. I’d like to earn my B.S. without too much stress/trouble, I’d like to be able to lift some of the financial burden of college off of my parents shoulders, I’d like to eventually have a significant other, and I would enjoy having a stable, well-paying career sometime in the next decade.",Woman,Woman of Color,Asian American,Adoptee,Bilateral Cleft Lip and Palate kid,Student,Tired,Anxious,Lonely,LGBTQA,Autopilot,Disgusted by anti-Asian views,Disgusted by anti-LGBTQA views,Disgusted by misogynistic views,,,,,,,2,3,5,5,1,1,2,5,1,2,2,4,5,5,1,2,5,5,1,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,3,2,5,4,4,4,5,5,4,3,4,5,4,1,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,3,4,5,2,2,4,4,2,3,5,3,2,1,3,4,3,2,1,3,5,3,4,4,Dependable,Imaginative ,Empathetic,2,4,1,3,4,1,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,4,1,3,2,1,3,3,7,1,7,8,2,8,6,8,6,6,5,8,4,6,4,6,8,6,8,4,8,1,5,8,6,8,6,8,6,2,4,5,7,4,7,5,7,5,7,4,6,7,7,7,3,5,6,2,6,1,5,2,5,6,3,4,6,3,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,1,2,4,2,6,6,6,5,5,3,5,3,2,4,3,4,3,4,3,2,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,2,3,4,4,3,4,,,,,5,6,6,4,6,5,1,5,6,7,7,5,1,1,1,6,6,3,3,4,4,2,3,3,4,2,4,5,5,4,3,5,2,2,5,2,5,5,3,4,2004,4,,,2,,3,,0,1,1,9,5,1,Human Development,,,,3.41,16568

My dog is living with me, and I walk her every morning and evening. It makes me feel relaxed and content while walking her, just like taking a break. I enjoy cooking even though I just learned how to cook by myself after attending college. My grandma did not allow me to cook when I was young because she thought that was dangerous, so later when I lived with my mom, she got annoyed by me when I wanted to help her in the kitchen because I could do nothing but cause trouble. But I have been interested in it, so I was really excited when I finally got to cook for myself. Since I am not living on campus, I can't make many friends at school as easier as those who live in the dorm. Especially because I am a transfer student, which makes that even harder. But of course, that is only my thoughts, other students may have different experiences than me. I tend to be more introverted these days although I am very energetic in front of my friends. I like making friends with people I like at the first sight. I really believe in my intuition. If I don't like someone, I won't fake myself, but I will always be respectful.

Possibly because seeing others try their best makes me also want to try my best. But sometimes I can’t stand this pressure so I try to find a quiet place, and frequently fail to do so- which is why I often study at home. I take the bus to school and back home, so when I feel tired I can’t really go rest at a dorm or in a car. I feel especially tired in days where I have long periods of wait time between classes- this often makes me want to skip my classes and watch the lecture video when I get home. However, doing that makes me fall behind- especially when I have a lab section where I must know what is going on in class. It’s especially difficult to rewatch lecture videos since I feel like I am not as involved, and don’t have other students around me pressuring me to pay attention or take notes. 

Sometimes when I start studying I easily get distracted. Or if I ever feel pressured and faced with anxiety-when I don’t understand something- I go on my phone and start reading mangas for comfort. They usually take my mind off of things- off of reality- as I read the stories of characters who are able to impress those around them. It’s very comforting, and it gets me excited to see how they face their problems and end with a happy ending. I also often times play music as I study to keep me entertained and not faced with silence. This type of music is usually jazz, phonk, or other random genre.

This makes me very happy because I rarely get to spend time with her outside of this time.

Although I truly enjoy this, I also get a bit tired because we wake up around 4:30 am to head to the gym at 5 on these days (except weekends are flexible). This can make me tired because in order to get the proper amount of sleep I need to go to bed around 8pm, but, I usually don't go to bed until at least 10 sometimes 11 pm. Outside of this, my day usually consists of waking up just before my classes (maybe 20 mins before) and quickly getting ready and packing my food from the day before and my electronics so that I'm all prepared for a long day of classes. This can be a bit nerve-wracking because I have to do everything so quickly. I know that this could be solved by waking up earlier, but I value my sleeping time too much.

It’s nice when we have enough staff and it isn’t too busy so I can bond with the residents, but that isn’t very often at this point. We are usually understaffed and the residents get very cranky very easily, so it can be an extremely stressful environment. I work there on Mondays, Wednesday, and sometimes Saturdays. I also work as a data entry intern for the MARBLES study for about 5 hours a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I’m really excited to be helping out at a research study like this especially considering that Autism affects myself and many family members, so it makes me feel like I’m helping in an impactful way. However, it is a very boring and monotonous job, but it gives me the chance to explore new music artists while I’m entering in the data. I am also the Vice President for a hiking and camping club, which is my main social outlet. I like all of my fellow officers, who I meet with once a week onTuesdays, and I love seeing all of the members when we have socials or go hiking on the Weekends.

I tend to take a little break at this time and just do something to recharge, whether it is relaxing, going on a walk, or chatting with my roommates. 

A couple important things about myself to share is that I typically enjoy spending a portion of my day alone, sitting with my own thoughts and processing interactions or experiences that have happened in my day or that have been influencing my life as of recent. I also value my friendships and being emotionally available for my friends. Sometimes this takes a toll on my own mental health, as I tend to take on a lot of other peoples problems, while also managing my own problems. This can get to be overwhelming at times.

But last week, this class was dropped because my waitlist didn't make it. So, my morning class is only Ant 002 on Tuesday and Thursday. This past Friday, I got up at 10am to make breakfast for me and my girlfriend. She ate and then went to school, and I had plenty of time to do my homework at home. With enough rest time while I was out in the afternoon, I had plenty of energy. I love the sunny weather, which is one of the things I love about California. Except for those two weeks of torrential rain at the beginning of the school year, every day my norm is to be bathed in sunshine. I get very low when it's rainy, and I get in a good mood when it's sunny. Whenever I encountered any difficulties in my study, going out to blow the wind and sunshine was my way of dispersing my mind.
I'm an international student from China and I'm sharing a room with four Chinese people. Usually we play games, play cards and talk together. We are all good friends and we are planning to go to Hawaii together during spring break. Sometimes they litter and don't wash the dishes, and I help them out most of the time. It's only when there's a good time that I mention it to them. I am a relatively friendly person and rarely lose my temper with others. I also have a very good relationship with my girlfriend. I usually cook and take care of her at home, and she is a very gentle and beautiful girl. My life in America is very exciting!

This can be physically noticeable to people, and it does affect my social interactions negatively. When it comes to work, I believe in putting in hard effort, which is reflected in my diligent handling of tasks and responsibilities. Some people have told me that I work too hard, even harder than the people who owns the business I work for and some had even gone to say that i'm trying too hard to impress , but I don't see it as trying to impress anyone. It just feels natural to me.

I identify as a Christian, but religion is not a central part of my life. I believe that the most important guiding principle for all humans should be the Golden Rule, ""treat others as you would like to be treated"". If more people followed this principle, I think the world would be a much better place.

As previously mentioned, I am a shy and reserved person and often become very tense in social situations. This leads me to limit my social interactions, which has resulted in me having few friends and being single. I am working on changing this behavior, as it has had negative consequences for my personal life.


My biggest desire is for personal and professional growth and development. This includes me setting and achieving career goals, exploring new opportunities, and building relationships and networks.

On top of my classes, I am in two research labs and I also work part time at a paid job on campus. I sometimes question if I am doing too much and sometimes other people question me. But I keep in mind daily that because my goal is to graduate early, I need to do these things in order to obtain the work experience. Because I am taking less units, I am happy that I get to spend more time taking care of body. I have tried to go the gym 5 times a week since the new year has begun. I am also trying to eat a lot healthier since I have more time to cook meals instead of eating out. 

On a weekly basis I mainly have a set schedule. I am happy that this quarter I can allow my body to sleep in till whatever time it wants to. Last quarter it was really stressful trying to wake up at 6 or 7 am and trying to catch the 8 am bus because the 8:30 am bus would always be late and I had a class at 9 am every day. On the days I have classes, I usually use the bus to get to school. The bus is always busy, sometimes very tight and stuffy. On the days I have work, I usually walk because it takes me 5 minutes to get there. I am glad that I get to live close to my paid job because I know it's not a possibility for everyone. 

In my free time, I try my best to spend time with my partner. My partner makes me really happy, supports me, and I am grateful that we have been together for a good amount of time. I look forward to the days that we can spend time together, especially to go to the farmer's market. When I am home, I try my best to give my family a call. I wish my roommates and I were as close as we used to be. I am really busy so I am not home as much. Two of my roommates do things I don't necessarily approve of because they seem to be failing more classes after they began to do certain things. I feel like it is a correlation and not a causation type of situation. I don't want to judge them or confront them about these issues, but I worry about them and their future because I want them to succeed. My roommates also frustrate me because sometimes they do not their chores on the days they promised to do them and sometimes they do not keep their promises and sometimes they take my things or come into my room without asking, which makes me sad and frustrated.

I believe in always trying to develop yourself. Living with integrity is super important to me. I am trying to live with gratitude for all things. I am trying to slow down and truly experience the events in my life. 

I do not like my job and am trying to reframe my experience with it to not be something negative in my life. I am enrolled at Sac State, attempting to obtain a BA while also working full-time. A degree will most likely not change my career outlook, but I still think it is good to push through the challenge and help me grow.

I have been looking to explore my emotions more deeply. I have a long trauma history and have been numb to my feelings for a long time, but I am finally in a safe space to work on myself in that way. 

I have an 18-year-old son who lives with me, and I am working on my relationship with him. Although we are close, we are not open with each other and keep conversations very shallow. He has trouble trusting adults, which is due to the past relationships I have had.

 My goal in life is to be happy, healthy and to form and maintain meaningful relationships with the people I love. Relationships are very taxing for me.

I love being at this school and I'm very motivated to do well and attend classes. However, like most students, there are times where I really have to push myself to study, do work, or attend class. I love being around my friends but I enjoy time alone, especially when trying to complete work or study. I would describe myself as talkative when the vibe of the people around me are welcoming and similar to my own. Otherwise, I can come off as shy or rude due to my lack of talking.
    I have a lot of beliefs and motives, many of which fluctuate as I think about them more. A lot of my choices revolves around my desire to succeed. I also have been striving to respect myself more and maintain a peaceful mind, which has also influenced my actions. Due to my beliefs, I tend to keep a small group of friends and even smaller group of people I trust. 
     I often work out as a form of stress relief and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I also love being in nature and outdoors to clear my mind.

If i wake up later I feel discouraged and feel like i've lost the day. I need to wake up this early as my morning routine is about 3 hours long. I have severe TMJ so I have to do about 20-30 minutes of physical therapy for my jaw 2-3x a day. I like to split it up and do it in the morning and at night. I've gotten used to it so it feels as necessary as brushing my teeth (even though if I'm out late or wake up late I feel reluctant to do it). For context, my TMJ is so severe that I usually limit how much time I spend with my friends because laughing and smiling for too long makes it hurt and I can only eat foods on the soft side. This has been an ongoing issue for about a year. I also have a torn hip labrum which has caused knee joint issues. This chronic pain makes it hard to sit or walk for too long. I also do 1/3 of my PT in the morning and 2/3 at night (combined about 2 hours long) daily. I've gotten to a point where I try not to think about the debilitating nature of my chronic pain but some days the limitations feel overwhelming. I tend to have less energy doing PT at night because I just want to rest after I've gone to school in the day. I go to school and have mostly online classes to be more flexible with my physical limitations. I try now to at least walk 1000 steps a day.

I notice on days that I don't spend time with my friends, I feel more lonely than not. This could be because I don't hang out much with my roommates and am physically limited on what I can do. I find that on days that I am not busy with school work or professional work, I feel in a more depressed state. This could be because I am left to my own devices. Sometimes I notice people who are jogging or exercising in public, I feel jealous because I wish I could walk normally without pain. If i find myself in a negative mood, I try to listen to music either to calm myself down when stressed or give myself upbeat energy when sad. I also tend to create art whether I am bored, feel creative, or are overwhelmed. I find art as a good outlet when I am sad or overwhelmed. I make an active effort to talk to at least two people a day outside of my house as I know my mood is low when I am left to myself and have not talked to people. After my health issues arose, I realized the impact of having meaningful connections with friends and peers. Around 7pm I usually feel fatigued after my classes and feel like taking a nap.

I often feel very tired when waking up, but have no trouble staying up to do more work. I personally find going out and interacting with too many people exhausting. This may partly contribute to how I don't feel excited during the mornings since most of my classes tend to be during that time. 

I also feel excited to talk to my friends and learn about new topics. In particular, last quarter I had a lot of enjoyment learning about Greek Mythology. This current quarter, I'm learning about the history of Dinosaurs, which is also very interesting. I think this partly contributes to how I feel excited during my late afternoons and evenings.

I wake up feeling groggy, I feed my cat and say hi to my best friend who I live with. When I'm getting ready I listen to music because otherwise I'll fall back asleep and it helps me think about something else than whatever weird dream I had. I'm too nauseous to eat so I don't until I get to campus, I think I might be avoiding eating a little as well. I'm sad a lot so sometimes I forget to eat. 
Most days I'm excited to go to class except for when I have to wake up at 8am to go on campus for one class. It is hard for me to pay attention in classes that happen before noon, possibly because of the insomnia. There are some discussions in class where I feel left out, because I'm either a first generation student or an immigrant. This however, gives me a view on the content of the class that people may not think about that I think is important in order to make the class accessible for everyone. 
For this quarter, my friend accompanies me to a class she enjoys and it makes the class feel less like a class and more like a YouTube video we are watching together, the discussions make me feel way more interested in the class than if she weren't there. The same applies for the class she's actually in, I tend to pay more attention to class if someone is there to catch things I didn't or when we're at home talking about the class contents it helps that we can talk it out. For the other class my other friend is in it, they like the class more than I do so it's nice to have someone who knows what we're doing when I get bored in class. 
After I get home I usually eat some food while watching a video, then I go to my room and work on my readings. It's easier in the afternoon to do work since I have energy and I'm not groggy, as well as the nausea leaving some time after I leave class. 
During the weekends I go to work in the afternoon, as my job consists of doing whatever it is I have assigned for that day and then leaving, it doesn't take me more than a couple of hours. I don't eat before leaving, because of the nausea so when I get home I eat and then I do chores.

I always hear rumors or news that is pretty relevant to my life. My life is pretty eventful.

About Me: I am currently a Resident Hall Community Advisor, meaning that I have many night shifts and I interact with many freshmen on the daily basis. I live with the freshman and I am older than most of my residents. I am also starting an internship in the month of February. In total, I will be working 40 hours a week ( 20 Hours as a Community Advisor and 20 Hours for the internship) and have a full course load of 16 units. I feel the most stressed in my Community Advisor jobs, especially on weekend rounding because many residents break policies, try to argue with you, and you have to write a lot of reports.

My Daily Life:
Sunday and Saturday: I start of my days waking up later in the day (10-11 AM). I wake up late some days because I have shifts that end at 2:30 AM on some weekend nights. I wake up, do my routine of skin care, have a little snack in my room (I skip breakfast), and chill for a little while. Then I start studying for my classes. After studying for a little bit, I get hungry and go to the dining commons to eat lunch. Then I go back to my room and study again. If I have time and if I feel like studying with friends, I bus or drive to my friend's apartments to socialize or talk with them. Occasionally, I go to my friend's apartment to party, play some games, and drink. On Some Sundays, I also work on a night shift in the dorms where I interact with my residents and update them on things that are happening in the week. After my shifts are over (around 12:30 AM), I go back to my room and continue studying until I feel tired.

Monday: If I have energy, I will go to my 8 AM classes but sometimes I will sleep in. I have many friends in that class and the professor is engaging. After the 8 AM class, I go back to my dorms, have breakfast, and study in the dorms and relax. At 12:30 PM, I go and eat lunch at the dining commons. Then, I walk to class, where I have class 1-4 PM. I go back to the dorms and rest. I usually have a night shift for the dorms, where I do admin work of making posters, and creating program events for my residents.

Tuesday and Thursdays: I only have one class this day at 9-10:30 AM. Then I go to my internship from 1-5 PM. On both of the days, I have also have a night admin shift in the dorms. These days feel overwhelming sometimes because I have to have good time management and energy in doing both jobs.

Wednesdays: I feel the most overwhelmed on this day. I have class 8-4 PM. I also have lab that day, which makes me feel stressed out because the lab work is individual work and not with partners. After class, I have a Community Advisor shift from 6-12:30 AM. I do my program events on Wednesday for my residents, where my residents get a chance to do interactive and fun events with me. A lot of my residents come, which I am glad that they appreciate my efforts in building a community. However, Wednesdays are really tiring as I do not have time for myself. Sometimes, I get emotional of how little time I have to relax, time for myself, or studying time. My whole day is gone just from school and work.

Fridays: I have class 8 AM and 1 PM. However, I don't go to those classes (unless I have to) for my internship. I work 8-5 PM those days. Sometimes after my internship, I go to my friend's house to hang out or party. I also sometimes am shifted on Friday evenings so I stay and relax. Overall, other than working on Fridays, I feel that it is my least stressful day.",Tired,Stressed,Eventful,Overwhelmed,Ambitious,Fun,Conflicted,Dramatic,Interesting,Entusiastic,Productive,Emotional,Tense,Energetic,Calm,,,,,,5,5,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,5,5,5,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,2,3,4,4,2,1,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,4,4,4,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,4,4,4,1,2,5,5,5,4,4,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,3,5,4,Reliable,Resourceful,Outgoing,3,1,1,2,2,1,4,2,3,3,3,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,2,8,6,8,8,8,4,2,7,8,4,8,8,8,8,5,7,4,1,3,3,8,8,6,8,7,8,7,8,8,3,6,2,4,3,5,4,5,3,3,5,3,6,3,5,4,6,4,5,6,3,5,5,5,6,4,3,4,5,4,3,4,6,4,3,3,5,3,2,4,3,3,4,5,6,4,2,2,2,4,4,1,2,4,4,2,3,4,1,3,2,1,4,4,3,1,1,2,2,2,3,6,5,5,5,2,5,4,5,5,5,2,1,3,6,6,2,4,4,3,2,2,5,2,5,5,3,4,1,4,5,5,3,5,2,5,4,4,3,2003,4,,,2,,1,,3,1,1,5,5,2,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,,,,3.72,16956

My brain gets very active at nights, typically starting at 8 pm. Another reason resulting in me staying up late is my college schedule. My body is much used to my biological clock, so I need a very strict schedule that is same or very similar every day. In college, my daily schedule and quarterly schedule frequently change, making it difficult for me to stick with a consistent schedule. Back to the topic, since I stay up late usually (recently I've been sleeping around 3 or 4 am), I also get up late, often after noon, which does not concern me at all. I've lived enough years to figure out that everything about me does not work well in the morning. I almost always feel drowsy and my body getting ""soft"" as well as my brain getting heavy, even if I have slept for enough hours within a healthy and consistent schedule. In the afternoon, my body is active and I often feel energetic, so I prefer going outdoors in the afternoon, to go to classes, to play sports, to resolve errands (like going to the bank, shopping for groceries, etc.), to hang out with friends, and so on. At night, I do a lot of brain work, including homework assignments, reading things (such as emails, mails, internet messages), and many more. I can do anything above at anytime, but I just prefer to do certain things at certain times as it appears to me that my brain or body adapts to it better. My emotional state is very stable, hardly with ups and downs. I barely have what I categorize as ""extremely negative feelings,"" such as anger, fear, etc. Even if I feel one of these at a certain time, it goes away quickly, usually about 5 or 10 minutes later. I call these extremely negative feelings because I think these feelings are very harmful for me, with no benefits to come. Sadness is also negative, but sometimes it produces insight or inspiration, at least for me; therefore, I don't consider sadness to be extremely negative. I sometimes feel emotional at nights, as my brain gets active. I have intense feeling of empathy and compassion, and I like to listen to music while singing along with it. Thus, sometimes I would feel really emotional when listening and singing those emo songs.

I will also talk about my hobbies in short. I love having fun from video games and watching videos. I don't play video games a lot, but I like to gain joy from playing as well as to train my reflex and to practice strategizing during the game play. I watch videos mostly from YouTube and Bilibili (a Chinese video platform). There are some video makers I subscribe to as I like their video content. One thing in particular about me watching videos is that I don't like paying to watch things. Paying for a membership makes me feel that I should watch as much as possible to ""make my money count,"" which clearly will stop me from enjoying watching videos. As I mentioned in the first paragraph, I like playing sports and hanging out with friends too. Playing sports is a good way to exercise while having fun at the same time. I mostly play badminton with my friends, and that's been really fun and motivating for me. Hanging out with friends is my major way of going outdoors. I'm not a fan of traveling, so I usually do not care about where we go; I just prefer to have some outdoor times with friends since apparently, staying indoors for too long is not healthy for us.",night owl,insightful or intellectual at night,energetic in the afternoon,consistent schedule,anti morning,stable emotional state,extremely negative feelings,sad or emo,insightful or inspired or enlightened,empathy,compassion,having fun/happy,indoor,outdoor,,,,,,,1,2,4,5,1,1,2,5,2,2,3,4,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,4,1,3,5,5,4,1,1,4,4,4,2,5,5,4,1,2,3,5,4,4,3,4,3,1,1,5,5,2,5,1,1,5,5,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,1,4,2,3,2,5,5,2,4,compassionate and optimistic,quiet at start but talkative when feeling more familiar,responsible and organized,1,2,1,3,2,1,4,4,1,1,2,4,1,3,1,3,2,3,2,2,6,2,7,4,1,8,4,7,8,1,5,4,4,7,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,4,7,8,5,6,7,8,8,3,7,5,8,5,6,5,6,3,6,4,6,6,5,6,2,4,2,4,3,4,4,1,2,5,4,5,4,2,4,1,4,1,3,3,1,3,4,6,5,3,6,1,1,5,1,3,6,4,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,1,3,2,3,3,3,2,4,3,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,3,6,4,3,6,7,7,6,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,3,4,3,2,4,4,5,4,5,5,2,2,3,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,4,2002,4,,,1,,1,,3,3,5,3,5,3,psychology,,education,,2.7,16765

I attend all of my classes and get good grades. I strive to do so well in school to make my family proud of me ands to prove to myself that I am worthy. My weekly schedule wasn't supposed to be too stressful but I am a person who needs to be busy to feel fulfilled. 
Mondays and Wednesdays are virtually the same. I start out with my 9am class with one of my close friends so I'm always excited to see her and go to class. I think what makes that class so exciting is the discussions I have with my classmates because I love meeting new people and getting to know them. After I usually wait in the library or SCC and do homework until 12 and we go to the gym together. I enjoy going to the gym because it helps me with my insecurities and makes me feel productive which makes me feel worthy. After the gym I go home and make myself a salad (I meal prep over the weekend so I just put the ingredients together), then I take a shower and get ready to go to my last class of the day with my roommate. The class isn't necessarily interesting but I like sitting in lecture and feeling like I'm learning something. After class we take the bus home together and I take a nap. Every day around 3-5pm I get a wave of exhaustion and sleep for 30 minutes to an hour. I then proceed to do homework and talk with my roommates which is the highlight of my day because it feels safe, comfortable, and relaxing to catch up about our day. I try to go to sleep early but I usually don't fall asleep until 1am because my mind is racing at night. I think this is because its dark and quiet so I feel free to think about imaginary scenarios in my head. 

On Tuesdays my class doesn't start until 10:30am so I wake up around 8am to make myself my daily breakfast wrap and get ready to take the bus. If I don't make my daily breakfast wrap I feel like I've messed up my whole day; one thing I've realized about myself is that I need to have a daily structured routine to feel sane and accomplished. On the bus I always take that time to catch up on social media or play games in my iphone which calms me down and gets me ready for campus. Another one of my friends is in this class with me but I wish she wasn't since she talks the entire lecture and I can't focus on taking notes (which makes me feel unaccomplished and behind in school). After the class ends I go grab a Peet's coffee and hang out with another one of my friends at the SCC. I love our weekly meetings because we catch up on our lives and complain about our boyfriends while drinking coffee and laughing. It feels like a stress-relief for the day. After that I go home since I don't have any more classes and clean the apartment because cleaning is how I relax myself and feel accomplished. 

I dread Thursdays. I'm on campus from 9:50am to 6pm with barely any breaks and I'm so tired by the end of the day because I didn't get my mid-day nap. I hate my CMN discussion because I'm so confused in the class and always fail the lab quizzes. The class makes me feel stupid and discourages me to try harder to improve. One thing I've struggled with throughout my life is when I'm not automatically good at something I lose motivation and get so mad at myself for not knowing how to do something. After the day is over I go home and take a nap and try to do some more homework. 

Fridays are easier because I only have 1 class but its a 2 hour math lecture and I hate math (probably because I'm not good at it). After that I go home and I've usually made plans with one of my friends to go out and get food or just to hang out. Sometimes my friends overwhelm me so I just stay in my room and listen to music and go on my phone for a bit. I'll hang out with my boyfriend and go to a party with him at night. I love going to parties because it's a way to get away from school and to let loose and dance and laugh with my friends. I wouldn't trade that time together for anything.

I live in student on campus housing and frequently socialize with those around me, resulting in feeling quite tired at the end of the day. I would definitely say I'm a little bit more on the emotional side and all of my personalities can show that. I have a long distance boyfriend, and would say my softest personality comes out with him. Everyday, I spend a lot of time texting and talking to him.

I spend a great amount of time with technology as my classes are recorded and mostly asynchronous. Everyday I typically have an assignment due every night. With 24 units, school is primarily on my mind and causes stress. I would say my biggest challenge right now is school and financial stresses. While I do have a job, hours have been cut and although it's given me more opportunities to study- money has been harder.

I think that strategy works well for me and I like to stick to it. Since I've roommates, I believe in texting things instead of verbally speaking. The reason I do this because its important to document conversations in a future scenario where there might be inter roommate conflict. The written texts will help a lot in arguing. I do a lot of roommates like picking up their packages and letters because there's risk of those packages get stolen. I describe myself as an 'over responsible and overly mature' roommate' .

Most of the work is done by me like cleaning common kitchen spaces, bathroom, toilet bowel. I'm the elder roommate and the other 2 are very immature which often leads me to get frustrated, sometimes going to the point of over tiring myself because I take initiative in a lot of things like cleaning but others don't show. That's why I hate them for their incompetency, their behavior is like a typical bachelor who doesn't give a shit about dirt and cleanliness in the house. Sometimes, I wish if only my financial situation was better, I'd live alone than handle all the tantrums. 
Like I said earlier, I'm a cold person so that's why I don't talk to my roommates because I'm always upset with them. Therefore, there is no point in talking to them.

I have a lot of ideas, goals, dates, and responsibilities that I write down in my journal because I tend to be very forgetful. Most days, I don't meet most of those goals because I overwhelm myself with too many things I need to do. Going to classes on campus can be a bit of a struggle, since I have a lot of morning classes that I don't really like to wake up for. If it's recorded, I'll usually stay home. If it's mandatory, I'll always make it albeit rather late at times. When I am on campus though, I'll make the most of the time I have on campus and study somewhere where there's a lot of people. I like being in the presence of people, even if I'm not talking to them, and I'd consider myself an extrovert because of this.

I also find that I am a very creative person, and I have a lot of ideas that I would love to execute if not for my poor time management. I have a tendency to start something and then not end up finishing it because I either lose interest or get too busy. It's the same with school. It should also be mentioned that I'm not too great as school. I am a STEM major, but deep down I think I was meant more for a career in design or something else.

I prioritize my relationships, friends, and family above many things, and I find a lot of happiness in spending time with them. Sometimes, I'll put off responsibilities just to spend time with them, which is bad admittedly, but I don't do it all the time. Additionally, I also love being outside, going on walks, and reflecting on my thoughts. This could explain my love for writing, both creatively and otherwise. Throughout my day, I like to write whatever comes to mind in my Notes app or journal. I also have an affinity towards fashion, so I also like thinking of different designs I could make or would like to wear (though I don't have the skills to execute yet).",forgetful,struggle for energy,liking people,creative,prioritize relationships,start something without finishing,affinity toward fashion,late,love being outside,love writing,extrovert,have lots of ideas,,,,,,,,,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,5,4,1,4,5,5,1,1,4,5,4,2,5,5,2,1,4,1,5,5,2,1,5,4,1,2,4,1,2,4,4,4,2,4,2,2,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,organized,charming,forgetful,1,1,2,4,4,2,3,3,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,3,3,1,8,8,1,8,6,8,8,5,8,3,6,6,4,8,8,4,8,4,,4,6,8,5,8,7,7,5,4,5,7,4,6,6,2,3,1,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,4,5,1,4,2,4,1,5,5,4,5,6,1,5,2,5,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,5,1,3,5,4,2,4,5,5,1,4,1,2,2,4,4,3,2,4,4,2,2,3,2,4,2,3,3,4,4,6,7,6,5,5,7,6,3,5,1,2,6,5,3,5,5,3,1,1,6,3,2,2,1,4,5,2,2,4,1,2,4,4,5,4,3,2,2,5,4,5,5,1,4,2002,"7,5",,1,3,genderfluid,4,no label,1,2,2,5,5,3,Biotechnology,,,,2,15416

Physically, I normally put academics first but mentally I tend to be worrisome of my relationships I have with others based on the amount of time I allocate towards them. The way I had set up this quarter (schedule-wise) was to allow myself to feel more available on Fridays to give my (both long distance and in-person) friends the time I feel is needed. I believe I’m this way because of the way I value others, but more specifically friends. I believe I’m this way due to my negative familial circumstances when I was much younger creating an “outlet” out of my friends. Recently I haven’t been able to manage my time evenly amongst my current friends, leaving me more stressed than usual, but I do hope to fix that through confrontational communication. 

My daily schedule normally consists of early morning classes, lunch with a singular friend (almost everyday of the week), and then a few evening discussions three times a week. I try to incorporate alone time by going to the gym two times a week, and some unscheduled time being spent on social media but sometimes I feel that that is not enough. 

Academically, I am in the process of choosing a different major. I had enrolled into the school as a Biological Sciences major in hopes to go down the pre-med track, but found myself more frustrated than happy during my first year here at the school. Given the workload, course grade results, and time allocations required I ended up being more stressed than I’ve ever felt. Although I understand academics do require a set amount of time, I felt that I wasn’t given a “fair trade” in terms of personal time vs. academic time. Currently I am enrolled in prerequisite courses for Cognitive Science, in hopes to possible pursue that major, and give myself the respective time for myself as a person.

I'm always considering how I can increase my wealth and improve my financial security.

My moods are greatly impacted by the people I interact with on a daily basis. When I'm surrounded by my close friends, I feel confident and sociable, and I enjoy being the life of the party. However, in unfamiliar social settings, I tend to be more reserved and quiet, as I prefer to observe and get a feel for the atmosphere before becoming more engaged.

When I'm feeling good, I sometimes act impulsively, which can lead to decisions that I later regret. To counterbalance these moments, I like to spend quality time with my loved ones, including friends and family. I value these interactions and find joy in the companionship and laughter that come with them. Additionally, I am passionate about making a positive difference in the world and I often lend my voice to causes that I believe will benefit society in the long run. I find a great deal of satisfaction in my weekly volunteer work, as it allows me to give back and feel like I'm making a meaningful impact.

I attend UC Davis and I scheduled my Mondays to be very easy with only one class in the afternoon to start the week. I also like to keep things pretty mellow (especially in the mornings) to prepare myself for the day. During breakfast, I mentally take note about what items to get for groceries and what chores or errands need to be done. I get anxious and stressed out easily about timing. I have difficulty preparing mine and my brothers meals everyday so that I have something for lunch between classes and so that we both have something ready for dinner by the time we head back home from work or school. I feel overwhelmed often because I also do most of the cleaning in mine and my brothers apartment. I have mentioned this to him but nothing has changed.
At school, I enjoy my classes but I dread having to make conversation with other students when asked. I have always been shy and nobody ever suspects, but I am roughly about 10 years older than any of the students in my classes. They are always so surprised to learn my actual age because I look younger than I am. I did not have the opportunity to go to college after high school, so I am back to get my bachelors degree. I am also a first generation student and it has always been my dream and goal to attend a university. Even though I enjoy my classes, many times I feel completely lost and don't speak up because I feel so out of place and dumb compared to how other students articulate their thoughts and questions during lectures and discussions. Most of the time, I do not see any other Mexican or Latin American student in my classes so that also adds to how I do not feel as comfortable speaking up.
I am back at school mostly for me but also for my mom. She has not had an easy life and I want to give her everything after graduating so that she does not have to work anymore. When I am in my bedroom at the end of the day, I give my mom a call to ask about her day and I always feel better after talking with her. She gives me the strength to continue trying and lifts my mood. It is very comforting to know she has always had my back and was the only one who believed me and understood when I was diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder (along with PTSD) when I was 20. Since that diagnosis, I feel like it is a never-ending work in progress. Exercise has helped me with this in the past and I used to workout daily sometimes even twice a day before attending UC Davis. However, I stopped working out completely the first quarter I started school. I had a very difficult time adjusting living away from home, but this quarter I now try to squeeze in at least 3 workout sessions for at least 30 minutes each every week.
I have a very supportive and optimistic boyfriend. He lives in Los Angeles and we see each other once a month for a straight week to deal with the distance. We have been together for 2 years and he will be coming up to stay with me soon in February. I always enjoy our time together the most because he is such a positive person and we get to dine at new restaurants and explore places together. I used to go out all the time and travel often before attending UC Davis. I actually met my boyfriend on a random boating tour in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Spending time together gives me a break from what seems my daily grind so that is when I am the happiest. We also work very well together with chores and errands when we stay at each others places so that makes me happy too. When he is away, he gives me little pep talks and encouragment when I have a hard time at school so those mean a lot to me too. Graduating from university would be so fulfilling for me so I am very glad he understands how important this is for me.
When I am alone and have free time, I like to draw or paint. It is very relaxing and that also makes me happy. It is another way I get to ""escape"".  Going to school is not easy but I will finally be able to start a career doing something I love and that will make it all worth it. I will be visiting my mom in Salinas this coming weekend too so I am looking forward to that as well. My nephew and niece also live with her so I always enjoy seeing how much they've grown since the last time I've seen them and spend time with them too. I think about having children of my own soon so that is another reason I want to finish school. Now as I am writing this, I think maybe I feel so overwhelmed because school is such a huge part to my life schedule. I didn't have a chance to finish before and now I need to get it done so that I can move on quickly to the next phase in my life now that I am in my 30's.",mellow mornings prepare myself,note chores errands,anxious stressed timing,overwhelmed cleaning,dread conversation students,dream attend university,feel lost dumb,mom call better,exercise helped,difficult away from home,break daily grind happiest,encouragement school,graduating university fulfilling,paint relaxing escape,school career worth it,nephew and niece enjoy,overwhelmed life schedule,,,,3,2,4,5,1,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,5,1,1,5,4,1,1,4,4,2,4,5,4,3,1,4,5,3,4,4,4,1,1,4,4,1,1,3,4,2,3,4,4,2,2,4,4,3,2,5,5,2,3,3,3,2,4,1,4,3,2,2,1,4,5,3,4,determined,thoughtful,compassionate,2,2,1,2,2,2,4,3,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,3,6,3,8,8,1,8,6,8,8,3,8,8,5,6,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,2,5,6,4,2,2,1,4,5,5,3,5,2,2,2,3,5,4,3,5,2,1,4,1,1,1,3,3,1,4,1,6,4,2,5,6,3,1,1,2,1,1,5,2,2,5,6,5,2,6,3,2,4,2,1,3,3,2,4,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,2,1,3,3,2,4,4,3,2,3,5,3,7,5,5,3,6,3,5,5,2,2,2,6,3,1,1,1,2,5,3,4,5,3,1,3,4,4,2,2,4,5,5,2,5,5,1,5,3,5,5,1,5,1992,1,,"2,3",2,,1,,1,1,1,1,10,3,Cognitive Science,,,,3.5,16609

Right now, I would say I’m doing very well. Last quarter, I decided to take a PELP leave for my mental health in order to receive treatment for depression. Initially, the first few weeks were hard because I felt so much shame about feeling this way and like I didn’t “deserve” to receive treatment. After about two months of therapy, health education classes, and medication, I began to feel better. I have experienced some family changes in the past month, including the separation of my parents. Had I not received depression treatment earlier, I don’t know if I could have handled this in the healthy way that I believe I am now. 

Part of my depression caused/or came from negative core beliefs about myself that impacted my relationships with others. I am a third year student, but last year was my first year on campus due to COVID. I had a hard time making close friends. I don’t have a ton of friends in Davis right now, but am really making strides this quarter to just try to be more connected with people, even if I don’t become “best friends” with them. A lot of interpersonal stress in my life came from avoidance and not asserting emotional boundaries. I am very introverted and need a lot of time to recharge, so I have to be careful about how much time I spend with others so I don’t feel drained. 

My day-to-day life right now is very focused around school and getting back into a routine. On Mondays, I have a therapy appointment in the morning. I used to feel anxious about these, but I have developed trust with my therapist and feel very light and free after my sessions. Then I go to business writing class, which I absolutely LOVE so far. I love writing and am planning to minor in it, so this is a great class for me. Then I have a break for a few hours, and usually head home to make lunch. I love cooking, and so I let myself get creative in the kitchen to fix a healthy meal with whatever ingredients I have on hand. After lunch and some rest, I get ready for my last class of the day. I head to my special studies in politics class, where I learn about foreign-aid and international development. I sometimes feel anxious in this class, because I feel like the energy in poli-sci classes can be a bit grating sometimes. Though I think this recent discovery has helped me realize what environments I’d like to work in post-grad. After taking the bus home, I make some dinner for myself. I work on some homework, complete some readings, and do whatever tasks I need to do for school. If I have free time, I’ll call my family and/or text my friends from home. I’ve been trying to stay more in touch with my friends back home to try to stay connected to people. If I am done with everything, I’ll watch a youtube video or a TV show until I get tired. I do my skincare routine, brush my teeth, and wind down for bed. Part of my nighttime routine is yoga nidra/yogic sleep, where I’ll stretch and meditate for about 20 minutes. After this, I get into bed and put on an audiobook, video essay, or lecture to fall asleep too. I do this instead of watching TV because I don’t have to stare at the screen and it feels *slightly* more sleep hygienic than watching TV. 

On Tuesday, I wake up at 7:30 to get ready for my 9am class. I get ready as fast as possible, and try to make a nutritious breakfast before I leave. This class is agricultural development, which I absolutely love and decided and want to pursue as a minor. I feel so valued and appreciated in this class — the professor is incredibly kind and values each and every one of our opinions. A lot of the work is focused on group discussion and reflective work, which is such a change from my other analytical classes. After this class, I head to my sheep lab discussion. I decided to take this class because I wanted to do something different (and lambs!). I was nervous about taking this as a social science major, but I decided to go for it anyways. After this, I head to my economics class. This is my least favorite class — economics professors are knowledgeable but can be extremely arrogant in my opinion. I love economics, so I do enjoy the content though. After this, I have about an hour before my next class. I’ll walk around campus and grab some lunch. Then I head to my agricultural development discussion section. I really enjoy and look forward to this class. I have made a few acquaintances in this class, and want to try to foster those friendships this year. After this, I have about an hour and a half where I can head home. I eat a snack and do any work I have to complete. Then I head back out for my economics discussion section. I don’t love this section, I often feel confused and like I’m behind when in this class.  Repeat monday night routine.

Wednesday: I wake up at 7, and bundle up in warm clothes for my sheep lab! I wanted to interact with the animal side of UCD, so I decided to take an animal science course about sheep. I head down to the Sheep Barn around 8am, and am feeling energized and excited. I feel a sense of calm hearing the quiet of the morning. It depends on the day, but so far we have seen the newborn lambs, which brings me lots of joy. After hardwork at the sheep barn, I head to my business writing class. I enjoy this class and am entertained by the professor. I have a few hours break, so I’ll usually head back to my apartment and make lunch. After resting for a little, I head out to my political science class. I don’t dislike this class, but it isn’t my favorite — I tend to not enjoy the people in my polisci classes as much. I head home after this, and get to work on my homework. Make dinner and repeat nightly routine. 

Thursday: I wake up at 7:30 and get ready for my IAD class. I head to the bus at 8:30 and have class from 9-10:30. I feel good after this class because I really like the professor and the people in it. Then I stop for some coffee/tea and try to find Cheeto while I walk past the physics building. Then I put in some music and go for a walk through the Arboretum to my economics class. I feel good on Thursday mornings because I finish early since I don’t have sections today! After my econ class, I try to do something fun to relieve stress. Then I rest as much as I can because I still treat Fridays as a work day, even though I don’t have any classes. Repeat night routine. 

Friday: I let myself sleep in until around 8:30 or 9 to catch up on sleep for the week, but I try to head out in the mornings to run errands. I find that it helps me to give myself a task so I don’t just lay around all day, which leads me to feeling depressed. I make sure to work on some school work, but also do something good for the soul. I’ll take a walk, go to a used bookstore, go swimming, or go to a UCD teaching kitchen class! I am making sure to prioritise wellness from now on, and that means doing things that feed my soul. I’m going to start volunteering for things that are important to me, like community food security, helping community cat colonies, and learning about local agricultural industries. I feel that my recent depressive episode actually led to a huge life shift, and even though I wouldn’t wish that on myself if I could go back, I feel like I learned a lot through that experience.

I shower and eat breakfast. From that, I walk to class.
Until this point, I am usually thinking about the day and hyping myself to study well. If I end up on my phone in bed, that ruins my mood cause my eyes hurt and I start to feel lethargic. 

My tiredness does hit me after lunch. That's usually when I go back to my room and study a little. Usually revising stuff I learned in the morning. 
I am excited about attending all my classes except my ENG100 class cause the professor is not good and the lab class is extremely tedious and tough. Being forced to work on circuits for three hours straight is not really learning inducive and ends up becoming something we just want to finish and leave.

I'm not sure why but it's really hard for me to get out of bed. For me, the day starts at around 12pm, which is lunch time. If I eat too much I'll feel tired after lunch but if not I'll be fine for the day. I usually don't study well in the afternoon. My brain tends to activate after dinner time and I study until 1 or 2 am. I would consider myself an emotional person but I find that I have the ability to think logically. I am able to think logically but my emotions tend to get in the way. I also tend to repeat scenarios in my head.

I wake up to one alarm at 8:20 each morning not particularly energized, but definitely not groggy and sluggish like a cartoon would portray a non-morning person. I stay in bed on my phone for a few minutes, eat breakfast, wash up, and go. The 10-minute bike ride to school is usually pleasant (especially if I play music on the way), though I admit rainy and extremely cold days worsen my mood. 
   I don't actively keep track of my thoughts. I think they mostly have to do with the tasks I'm focused on and the things I have to complete and convincing myself not to spend $5 on a matcha latte. I think nighttime is more loose in thought for me. I think about random things and wonder about how friends are doing. Oftentimes thoughts surrounding self-reflection come when I talk with friends, especially when we talk about deeper subjects. When I don't have anything to do, such as when I'm waiting in line for something or taking a mental break, my thoughts are very quiet- I don't think I think about anything at all usually. I'm also a pretty emotionally stable person. It's hard to get me angry about something, and I'm typically either calm, happy, or slightly stressed because of schoolwork at any point of the day. 

   Tuesdays and Thursdays I have class non-stop from 9am until 3 or 4pm, and I often go from a very awake, aware state, to drifting off (and occasionally napping in my middle class), to awake and slightly distracted during class time. 
   Mondays and Wednesdays I only have one class at 1pm, so I stay in bed for a couple hours and cook myself a (usually) healthy lunch before class, where I stay attentive and thoughtful throughout. During all of my classes, I like to have my planner open so I can update assignments immediately and remind myself of upcoming deadlines so I know how I can schedule my afternoons. 
Fridays I have no class, so I count it as part of the weekend. I often try and catch up on schoolwork, host a dinner with friends, run errands, and relax. I also recently got a job as a UC Davis tour guide, so I schedule training sessions on Fridays and get paid to study the script if I go into the Welcome Center on Saturday mornings. I try to make the most of it. 

   I'm very comfortable around peers and professors, with no social anxiety or awkwardness, though in my LDA classes many of my peers have their own social circles that I sometimes feel I should have within my department. Overall, I feel pretty belonged at Davis and at my hometown. I find friends of similar cultures and mindsets, and while I learn from and experience differences with some peers at school, it's never felt hostile or uncomfortable to me. 

   As an overview of myself, I'd like to start by saying I am a Christian. It's been pretty foundational to the way I've been raised and the way I view things and go about life. I identify as a cis female, Asian-American and Chinese, and as a beloved child of God. I am not anxious nor depressed, and I like to think I take pretty good care of myself mentally and physically. If I'm feeling extremely tired, I would rather take a late assignment or email a professor about an extension rather than pull an all-nighter. I try to put my well-being above my studies, my studies above my social life, and my social life above staying at home and wasting my life away watching cat videos on Instagram. 
   My social life is pretty nice, if I do say so myself. My main friend group is from a Christian club on campus, that meets Tuesdays and Thursdays formally, and often hangs out randomly throughout the week as well. I try to invite a few of them out to dinner at least once a week. I also have a couple friends outside of my club, whom I coordinate a weekly study session with at the beginning of each quarter or randomly get together with every once in a while. When I'm with my friends, you could usually spot me smiling. I love being with them, and they always make me laugh. I enjoy hearing their life stories and joking around with them. Sometimes going to small or large group for club meetings can feel stressful because I need to coordinate my schedule around it and do my homework ahead of time, but at the same time I'm usually excited to go and it's always worth it in the end. I enjoy spontaneous, unplanned hangouts very much, and I'll find myself spending an hour or two with a friend randomly at least once or twice a week. 
   Some of my goals in life are to simply do good works, be the best person I can be, and follow Jesus as best I can. The biggest challenges I face in the day-to-day are staying on top of schoolwork and balancing my work-life well. I often wish I had more time to be with friends, or that I spent more time seeking after God, or that I could bring myself to learn fun things in my free time or exercise, but oftentimes my tiredness, laziness, and schoolwork prevent me from doing those things.

I find myself the happiest when I'm with family or friend, especially if there's conversation over food (like when I'm eating with someone). 

My mood is usually affected if I don't get enough rest or I get too deep into thoughts that makes me upset. The past few years, I've noticed that school and trying to be a people pleaser causes me to be stressed and sometimes sad. I also struggle a bit with time management, so sometimes the reasons I stress is stemed from my previous actions. I recently got back into Christianity, so I tend to find myself in a bit of internal conflict and but too much pressure on myself to feel need to fit into the perfect mold. But, depsite the challenges I face internally or externally, I push myself to overcome them and reassure myself that everything will be okay.

Every Friday I work after my classes, and on Wednesday I have a lab so tuesdays are often spent prepping and doing the pre lab after my classes and choir practice, which I have on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I’ve felt generally quite fatigued thus far in winter quarter, but I am attempting to keep my energy by writing down my tasks in a planner.

I have noticed though that I feel much more relaxed when I’m on top of schoolwork and other commitments and don’t have too many things to do. I know I usually feel energetic in the mornings if I’ve had enough sleep, and I’m usually in a good mood during my morning classes. I think I enjoy my morning classes this quarter because they’re very participation based, and I like sharing my ideas with my peers and hearing their thoughts. However, after lunch I feel pretty drained, because I’m reminded of the work I need to do. I also have 2-3 hours of free time after lunch, which I usually don’t spend productively even if I try to, and this tends to stress me out. Most days of the week I have evening classes, and I find it incredibly difficult to stay focused because of these emotions, which makes me feel even worse. By the time I get home I’m exhausted, but my mood does tend to improve if I manage to finish everything I need to do in less than 4 hours. 

More generally I would say the feelings that I feel often are loneliness and a fear of the future. While I think I have a good amount of friends and I tend to talk to them frequently, I often feel like I’m putting on an act and not being myself around them, and if I were to be myself, they wouldn’t want to be around me. I don’t know if I’m actually doing this or not, and there are no concrete things I do to act like someone else, but I just feel like I’m performing as someone all the time and it makes me feel lonely. I try not to think about these things too much though.

This usually means waking up 60-90 minutes before class. This means I usually wake up between 11:30-12:30. Before class, I like to eat something I make at home, something from campus, or something from Panera. I try to go to Panera before class, because I have their membership that allows one free drink cup per day. MWF I have class until 4, TR until 5. I find my classes' material enjoyable, but find I do tend to get a bit tired at some point in class. After my last class, I like to do homework until 5:30-6, with the time I work really depending on when my last class is over. I go to the gym to run on the indoor track after I do some work, currently at around 25 minutes. After the gym, I will continue to work on work that is due soon. When I have decided I have done a sufficient amount of work, I either drive or bike over to my friend's place and hang out till around 1:30am. Whether I bike or drive is decided by what I have to bring (will drive if I have to bring more than can fit in a backpack), the weather (I don't like biking in rain and wind), and my energy level (some days I don't have the energy to bike 10-15 minutes). When I go home, I shower, brush my teeth, and go to bed, usually around 3:30am.

I like to eat my dinner at my friends place; I don't have to use the utilities at my house if I need to cook, and I find I enjoy eating more in social environments. Even when I don't have anything planned with my friends, I still go to their place just for the fact I enjoy their company. It is out of the ordinary if I do not go to their place at some point in a day.

I watch and listen to a lot of youtube and music; to an amount I feel is excessive. I find I typically don't go to bed when I maybe should because I watch youtube after I shower. Sometimes I feel like I aimlessly browse youtube or spotify so I can watch or listen to something interesting, even when I don't know what that is.

Sometimes, I notice (whether from not sleeping enough, being hungry, or not having my coffee) that I feel grumpy. However, I still try to be pleasant around those I have to interact with.

I don't talk to people I don't know or don't need to interact with. In a normal day, the only people I will talk to are my professors, my friends, or a cashier if a store doesn't have self checkout. I am not especially keen to collaborate with my classmates when tasked to.

I tend to find it annoying when people on bikes don't follow the rules of the road. As someone who uses their bike for most of their transportation needs, I find it's important to follow the same rules as a car would. As a result, it annoys me when I see bicyclist run stop signs (especially downtown), bike without lights at night, and do not yield to passing rules (cruise on the right side; pass on the right; give space on the right to pedestrians). It is also annoying to me when pedestrian walk in the middle, or to the left, in a shared bike lane.

Weekends are my personal time. I wake up whenever I wakeup (anywhere between 12:30-2:30pm), and get up to start the day once I feel it is time to get out of bed (anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours after waking up). Usually, I will take some time after I wake up to get dressed. I typically go to Panera for my daily coffee, and to take care of work if I have some. I may continue working when I get home from Panera (around 3:30-5:30pm), or I may decide to do something else (nothing specifically). No matter what I do, I will still go to my friend's place over the weekend as well.

My everyday thoughts and feelings don't always exactly define who I am as a person either. Like other college students, I want to go out, I want to party, and to meet other people. However, there is always that nagging feeling and that dread in my stomach of untouched homework and hours of studies I have to make up in exchange for my social life. Locking myself in my room started to become a trend every time midterms and finals started to approach around the corner. I would skip meals and skip classes just to catch up on all the materials that piled up over a course of time that exist in my subconscious mind. Despite this, I feel an exhilaration while working under pressure, while catching up on weeks of lecture 2 days prior to the midterm, or even pulling all-nighters leading up to the exams.  Similarly, when I am out, the adrenaline of a carefree life excites me, and I'm allowed to really let go after an hour of being out or so.

It makes other people feel calm and organized when they are around someone that acts like they don't care about anything. I think it's important to take care of yourself but to do so and actually do interesting things is very difficult. I try to be really hopeful about the world, but things can be pretty bad sometimes. I think I notice a lot of patterns that people have, but I don't think there is anything useful that comes from that information. I used to think that you should just care about people and love them because there was something that you could gain from it, but now I just enjoy being around people for the fact that they are people. 

I think my relationship with sports is really interesting because I really enjoy playing water polo. It gives me a lot of confidence and makes me really happy even when I'm feeling sad.

Pretty much every extracurricular activity I do is something music related- I'm a cellist in a trio, and a trombone in marching and campus band. While I'm practicing or performing I tend to be the happiest I think, I'm able to be totally lost in music and that can feel pretty amazing to share with other like minded musicians. To an extent, I feel the same when I'm practicing martial arts, but I don't do that quite as much since I'm far away from my dojo. So generally, I'd say my peak moments in any given week are when I perform or rehearse with my trio or bands (some combination of those things happen every day except Sunday)

Recently I've been under a lot of stress from midterms and my auditions for DCI (drum corps international, it's like... professional marching band) so I haven't really been able to relax at all, I always need to be practicing or staying on top of course work. A typical day includes maybe 2-3 hours of lecture or discussion, 1-4 hours of rehearsal, and the rest is practice or studying. Fortunately the stress hasn't gotten to my sleep I think, I've always been an Insanely deep sleeper, literally nothing on the planet can keep me from dozing off within a few minutes. Honestly, the stress from auditions and midterms isn't all too bad. There's a lot I need to be doing all of the time but I tend to prefer being busy to having long periods of time where there's nothing I really need to be doing. I like feeling productive. For that reason, I honestly really dislike transition periods between classes where you can't Really do anything- or when large chunks of time are spent transporting instruments or dropping things off at the dorm. That drives me... nuts. I also tend to be pretty unhappy while eating- I've had a really complicated relationship with food, and I honestly would just prefer if I could have a tasteless slurry that gave me all the nutrients and macromolecules I needed to live.

I think overall I've been pretty happy this quarter- last quarter was a completely different story and I genuinely thought that I would die but so far, this has been totally manageable! and I'm not taking chemistry, so that definitely improves one's mood....

I am currently a first year at UC Davis. I have felt really lonely being away from everyone I know. It has gotten better in the winter quarter but still persists. Especially in the first quarter, if I was out the whole day, I would realize I went the whole day without talking to anyone (until I went back and talked with my roommates). Moving has brought a lot of old problems and insecurities, especially with how I feel towards myself and peers. I fear incompetence and part of that includes feeling socially competent but the lack of close relationships hindered that.

I get excited to get things done and feel accomplished. When I go home (because I am a commuter) from UCD I feel drained, especially if there's traffic that day. Even when I am drained, I feel the need to get things done because of the amount of course work and studying I have to do. I also get distracted very easily so it's sometimes difficult to get a lot done in one sitting. 

On the weekends and any breaks I get in between school, I like to thrift and it's probably my favorite hobby. Because of this, I have a small business buying and reselling vintage clothing. Every other week I sell vintage clothing at a market in Davis. Besides thrifting, actually selling at markets is another one of my favorite things to do. It excites me knowing that there are people out there that enjoy the same things I do. Seeing someone excited to buy something that I curated is so fulfilling.

And honestly, that's how I like it. I've realized that having to constantly work allows me to distract myself from things that trouble me, and that when I have free time, that I think I am at my worst. Every day I eat breakfast at 9:15AM, and from there, go to my classes, labs, sports etc. until around 11PM and then go back and sleep, just to do it again the next day. The system works for me. 

However weekends tend to be a little more difficult to fill as I don't have classes. Usually I go study in the library for a few hours and then spend time with my friends. I typically party on the weekends even though I don't think about myself as a party person. I think it's mostly FOMO. 

I tend to be a pretty quiet person and be very shy around others, however when I get to know people and they get to know me, I start to feel a lot more comfortable and honest. This has always been a little difficult for me because I find it extremely difficult to relate to people, for no particular reason (that I can identify), which makes me feel closed and emotionally unavailable. 

However, sometimes I am content with who I am and the way I am, although it's not often. I feel like I am at constant competition and always need to be better or smarter.

I try my best during the school but I feel like I have a hard time trying to set goals for myself in the future. I am very much a  person who thinks on things I could do in the present and what can i do now to for myself in the future. I am a more introverted person and I really enjoy finding creative outlets whether that is drawing or watching movies and tv. I say that I enjoy the stuff and when I do i really enjoy creativity, but I also have a hard time finding the time to sit down and do hobbies outside of school. 
     I am generally a happy person but I think at times especially at night, I tend to get anxious and even existential about what could happen in specific situations. Wondering where I will be, how my relationships with my friends are, the future with my partner and other things that could happen if I think hard enough about them.  Throughout my day to day life, I really find pleasure when I have time to walk around and listen to music, being able to listen to music for me is revitalizing. Except this experience is currently being hindered because only one side of my headphones work and I can't find the case to my wireless headphones. I live in an apartment far away from my family. Well they live in California but more south then me. I miss them sometimes and I wonder how my dynamics change since I have moved for college. I especially miss my twin sister. I feel like day to day i try to find little things for self care and finding little ways to enjoy myself. Buying a treat ,listening to music or even looking outside the window in a packed bus on the way to school. When its the weekends I try to find an activity to do whether that getting coffee or roaming around stores.

At times, stress makes it difficult for me to sleep which causes me to feel tired the next evening. 

As a child, I was very extroverted and did not care what other's had to say. After transferring to an academy, I became obsessed with academics. I feel that this negatively impacted my social skills, which I am working to improve upon. Generally, when I'm around peers, I often feel out of place because I am on the quieter side. I feel like I have trouble holding a conversation and always wonder if what I'm saying will offend anyone and if they will accept me. It takes me a longer period of time to become comfortable with people compared to others. Some of my friend's said I looked cold/mean/smart kid at first so it was hard for them to approach me but when they saw me talk to other students and approach them, their negative perceptions changed to positive ones.

I am also a first generation and I often compare myself to my successful older brothers (they're 10 years older than me) because I want to be proud of myself and want my parents to also be proud of their daughter.

The more time I have available to complete an assignment, the less focused I'll be while working on it, so it takes me the full amount of time. This makes me feeling unproductive, because I know I could have done the assignment in less time plus another activity. On average, I attend three club events a week (meetings or socials). The main clubs I'm involved in are Rotaract, which is a community service club, and American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). I also attend free events I see advertised on campus, such as puppy therapy during finals, free Mondavi shows, the Aggies Leading the Way Conference, blood drives, etc.

My class schedule this quarter has 8:00AM classes Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. My last class ends at 7:00PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. My school days are long because I try and attend all office hours for my classes (professor, TA, and tutor). I spend most of my time on campus, which I think is good for me because I'm more productive when I'm around other people doing work than when I'm alone in my bedroom. My schedule this quarter is one that matches up well with my study habits. 

To keep track of all my classes and events, I have a very detailed Google Calendar. I'll leave a few breaks throughout the day, but mostly I know what I should be doing at any given moment.

I wear Invisalign so it is uncomfortable to snack and eat during the day. Because of this, I can be very tired and cranky during the day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I will want to take a nap during the day which makes it hard to focus during class. 

I do not own a bike, so I typically walk or take the bus everywhere. On days that I walk, it takes me around 20-30 minutes to get to class because I live off campus. While walking, my feet hurt and I can become very tired and out of breath. This is why I prefer to bus. I love hanging out with my friends whenever I have free time.

But sometimes when I am in classes where I sit with new people I met, I sometimes get internally anxious. I often feel like since I am around new people, I need to put up a good front so they have a good impression of me. I also overthink about what I should have conversations about because I have a hard time thinking about how to connect with people (as much as I want to). I enjoy my lunch break because it is my alone time to eat and I get to watch my favorite shows. After lunch, I have a class that I usually get sleepy in but get excited after class because I get to go home and eat food.
My favorite part of the day is my alone time at night. I sit at the dinner table, where I do my work, decompress, and enjoy my hobbies. Often, my roommate comes over and interacts with me which I don't mind but sometimes throws me off because she occasionally has something to vent or confide in. I appreciate that I am a safe space for her but I often feel like I am cannot present myself with the best energy for her when she approaches me during my relaxation time. In other instances, I have dance practices at night time where I interact with people from my club. Whenever I am around them, I feel motivated and energized. Even if I had a lot on my mind that day or am physically tired, I don't think about the troubles when I am at practice. Sometimes right before practices or meetings, I get extremely nervous anticipating the event but when I am there, I don't feel as scared anymore. When I am nervous I think about the possible things that could happen at the event and that I have to ask people for a ride after since I don't have a car and feel bad about it. 
Also, think about your reasons for experiences/behaviors/etc. Is there another reason you get tired after lunch other than the time of day? What about that lab course ruins your mood? Do specific peers trigger your first gen identity more than others? There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is simply to help you think about yourself and everyday experiences as well as what you think drives those. Even though, night time is when I get to relax, it is often when I do my homework as well. So many days I will feel stressed because of the overwhelming amount of things to handle for the week.

Will be happy for a little thing to jump up and down, but also a little hiccups can seriously affect the mood. All of my friends will tell me sincerely that they really enjoy spending time with me, but I worry about whether I'm negatively affecting them when I'm with them. (Of course I like them too.) I am an international student from China and feel like I have gone from being an extrovert to a bit of an introvert because of this. I love small animals and now I have adopted a kitten myself. I can get a lot of energy from him, especially when I'm under a lot of pressure to study. I'm a pretty smart kid, but don't like to work hard. The stage when I needed to be quiet when I started studying was always painful, so I would always pile everything up to the end. But this sense of pressure created by leaving it to the last minute can bring me a sense of shame and anxiety. But again, studying is also painful.

I can get stressed out from trying to make all my assignments perfect and getting As in all my classes. Despite this, I try to make time to calm down and have fun, such as having time to myself and going out with my friends. I have the most free  time on Mondays, Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays which is usually when I try to catch up on work or destress. My busiest and most stressful days are Wednesday and Thursday as I have lots of classes and a lab on Thursdays. I often am happiest after my day has ended on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I have choir rehearsal which is rejuvenating. 

While classwork can be stressful, it also gives me a sense of accomplishment when I do well in a class. This pushes me to keep doing well and I feel very happy once I have completed a hard task. The downside of this is that if I do not meet my own expectations of what I could do in an assignment or test, I will feel terrible about myself and shutdown.

In terms of abnormalities over these three weeks, I have an internship interview on 2/10 that I am very worried about because I have not had an interview before. I also am stressed about the responsibility that will come with having an internship along with my schoolwork. Additionally, someone that I love might visit me the weekend of 2/25, which will make my much happier.

I also have midterms on February 16, 17, and 27 and a writing assignment due the 22nd, all which will contribute to my stress in preparation.

Depending on the day, I'll either wake up early or be able to sleep in. But either way, I wake up usually feeling pretty tired already. Almost a little groggy, feeling like I want/need to sleep more but don't have time to or can't fall back asleep. I'm unsure of the reasoning behind this because on average I get 8 hours of sleep which is said to be good for my age. 

Typically in the morning I am very time orientated, I'm always watching the clock and making sure I stay on time with my morning routine so I can get out the door on time for class or for general plans. There are a lot of steps to my morning routine, so I'm usually just occupied with thinking about all the things I need to do (brush teeth, wash face, moisturize, contacts, eyebrows, chapstick, brush hair, perfume, clean piercings, jewelry, clothes, pack bag, refill water, shoes, etc.) By the time I'm finished getting all ready, I'm usually right on time to leave my apartment and drive to school.

The first experience of the day, outside of my apartment, is the cold weather outside and in my car. It's always freezing in my car and I have to set up the heater a certain way to maximize fast heating. Next I will be thinking about what kind of music I'm in the mood for. Music is a big part of my daily life and it influences how I feel a lot. I make sure to put on something I'm interested in listening to at the moment because it's always based on my current mood. 

I drive to school and park at the parking garage. Some days I do experience a little mild anxiety because I get very anxious when it comes to being late to things. There are a lot of factors that I think about on my drive to school that could cause me to be late. Some for example: being stuck behind the train, being stopped at every red light, a possible car crash, slow drivers, and most importantly traffic. Traffic makes me most anxious because it's sometimes unpredictable but I make sure to allocate enough time in the morning to either beat or accomadate for the traffic. Then I need to think about finding a parking spot which occupies my mind for the next 5-10 minutes as I drive up and through the parking garage. 

Once I've found a spot to park, there are a few things I always make sure I remember. 1. pay for parking, 2. think about what time I should leave my car in order to get to my class at a good time, 3. what music should I play while I walk over there, 4. do I feel like using my airpods or headphones, and 5. remember exactly where you parked and what staircase you took because I have a fear of forgetting my spot and never finding my car again. 

Each day while I'm walking to class, I'll think about random things that I have going on in the day, but mainly I'm listening to my music and singing it in my head. I'm also hyper aware of my walking and I think about it and how people may perceive me based on how I'm walking. 

Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, my first class tires me out really fast. But after those lectures are done, I get coffee which I really look forward to because I love coffee. I also get food during this time for lunch. I'm usually with my friend(s) after my first class too so I'm mainly focused on whatever conversation we're having, thinking about random things.

My other classes for the days really drain me. I have two back to back lectures and usually I'm falling asleep during them because I get super tired. I don't know the reason for this because I make sure to eat food and drink coffee. I think I'm a person who needs little naps throughout the day but that doesn't exactly fit in my everyday schedule. So I just try my best to stay awake and pay attention by taking notes. 

By the end of the day, I usually just think about how tired and hungry I am and how much I want to lay in my bed. While I drive home in the late afternoon, I'm also thinking about what homework and other important tasks I need to do. I also think about upcoming events and what I'm going to get/make for dinner. I enjoy hanging out with my friends on the daily. But some days when I'm really drained, I don't talk much with my housemates because I don't have the energy after a long day. But other days I do look forward to hanging out with them, it really just depends on my mood.

I try to make my bed every morning, and it feels off when I can't do it for fear of being late to class. I often skip breakfast due to waking up late, and after my morning class I go to work. Work is peaceful because it allows me to unwind from school work, especially since my supervisor lets us listen to music. I go back to campus for more classes, and then go back to work. The bike rides around school and to work can either be stressful or relaxing depending on how much time I have, the amount of people around, or the weather.

I try to work out most days by going on runs, and I always feel more energetic and in a better mood after. When I'm in a really bad mood, running always helps me get out of my funk. Once home for the evening, I tend to be more happy as I get to catch up with my roommates. It's easier for me to open up to them because I feel more comfortable around them compared to peers in class. When I'm around peers, I tend to feel stressed because I'm worried I'm not as smart or that I don't deserve to be here. I think this is due to a series of bad chemistry grades, which lowered my confidence as a student severely. I also feel like I don't know how to connect with them very well, so I tend to stay quiet, and when no one inevitably talks to me, it fuels my anxiety that I'm not someone people would want to hang around. Dinner is one of my favorite meals because I get distracted from school work, and its a nice way to relax.
 
Before I go to bed, I go on my phone or read or talk to my roommate because I don't like falling asleep without being distracted. If left alone with my own thoughts, I'll eventually stress myself out by contemplating things that are out of my control (state of the world, death, faith, etc. As part of my routine, I'll remove an extra pillow and stuffed animal from my bed so that they're not in the way. 

On Fridays I wake up stressed because I have an early morning class, then only a ten minute gap before my chem lab, which always makes me panic that I'm going to be late even though my ta told me it's okay if I'm a few minutes late. Our first lab also went late and was almost a failure, so I'm always worried that the lab will be really difficult or time consuming, and that I'll somehow mess up and get a bad grade. Afterwards, I go to one of my favorite classes, which always fills me with relief, so Fridays start off bad but end well.

I usually feel most comfortable when I am with my girlfriend, and I get to see her most days.
I am extremely stressed and overwhelmed with classes and writing a thesis so I have been very high-strung and irritable, and sometimes I feel like my behaviors/reactions are more motivated by feelings than rational thoughts, but I am trying to start meditating to improve that.
I tend to have obsessive self-deprecating thoughts, but I usually correct them by telling myself the opposite of whatever I thought, but that too gets tiring and I feel burnt out most of the time. 
I am most energetic in the late morning and start to crash in the late afternoon, likely because I wake up at 4 am to go to the gym.
I run the club People for the Elimination of Animal Cruelty through Education, and every day I spend a bit of time doing some sort of animal rights activity (meetings, emailing to my club, social media posting, etc). Doing things for animal rights is usually enjoyable and energizing, as that is a great passion of mine, but sometimes it gets hard to balance with school and work.
In the mornings, I usually feel like I do not want to go to work (I am a writing tutor) but once I get to work I feel better because I really like my job, as helping others brings me joy and makes me feel useful.
I always dread Tuesdays because I have work, classes, and meetings non-stop from 9 am-6 pm, including my lab for 'Statistical Analysis of Psychological Data'. I absolutely hate that lab because coding is very difficult and confusing for me and I do not like to feel like I am bad at things. I put a lot of pressure on myself to exceed expectations and as much as that stresses me out, I know that over-working myself is a coping mechanism.
I always look forward to Fridays because I do not have classes or work and I get to see an EMDR therapist to hopefully start decreasing the flashbacks and obsessive thoughts I get every day.
My favorite part of the day is going to bed and I look forward to spending calm time at home with my roommate and cat.
I am also looking into potential grad schools and gap year options because I just got denied from the grad school I applied to, so that is a massive weight on my shoulders. However, I am getting some support from the graduate students in the psychology research lab I work in and I like going into the lab and spending time with them.",constant underlying depression ,stressed ,overwhelmed ,motivated by feelings,work ,hate that lab,pressure on myself,flashbacks ,obsessive thoughts,irritable,comfortable with my girlfriend,animal rights is enjoyable and energizing,rational thoughts,,,,,,,,4,3,3,4,3,5,1,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,1,1,5,5,2,1,4,3,4,5,4,5,2,1,5,5,1,2,5,5,2,3,5,5,2,1,5,5,5,4,4,3,1,2,4,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,5,4,2,1,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,3,4,5,dedicated,compassionate,perfectionistic,4,2,4,3,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,4,2,2,8,5,8,8,3,8,5,8,8,1,5,4,5,4,5,8,8,8,7,6,7,3,6,1,6,8,4,6,8,8,5,7,1,8,5,1,4,1,4,3,6,6,1,3,6,3,3,2,4,5,6,4,5,6,4,4,6,1,3,4,4,3,6,2,2,2,1,5,2,5,1,3,1,5,1,1,6,6,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,2,3,4,4,4,1,3,2,6,1,6,5,6,5,6,3,6,1,3,7,7,1,1,1,6,7,3,4,4,5,1,4,4,5,1,5,5,5,1,2,5,4,2,4,4,4,4,5,2,2001,1,,,2,,2,,1,4,1,4,5,4,Psychology,,,,3.94,16804

I like to give myself 20 minutes in bed after my alarm goes off before I get up to brush my teeth, and wash my face. If I'm staying at home for the morning or the day, I will make my bed and walk outside to the kitchen where I usually greet my best friend and roommate, Emily. We make a quick coffee or breakfast if time allows. Then I head back to my room to either do some studying/homework or get ready for a class. If I need to study I like to do it early in the morning when I feel the most energized because I feel like once the sun sets I get lazier and push off my work, and then I fall behind. I love spending time with my roommate, we cook together, laugh together, do homework together, and we even fly back home for holidays together. This is a good environment I live in for sure. As for my workload, I have a pretty medium-level workload this quarter. The days I despise are Mondays and  Thursdays. I have 2 and half hour physics labs on those days. The reason I don't like physics labs is that I am not too strong when it comes to the subject of physics and the time these lobs take up, also takes a lot of energy from me. I am usually exhausted after lab and can't finish much work. I also talk to my parents from back home on a daily basis.

For example, when I got a flat tire the day before driving down to L.A, I thought,"" If this didn't happen today, it would've happened on the drive down which would be much more dangerous.""  Despite the hassle of finding new tires and the incident completely ruining my schedule and day, I decided to look at it positively. I however have a bad habit of over thinking and making up nonsensical daydreams of what might happen. I am trying to fix that which is quite hard. When I overthink, my stomach turns upside down and I lose my appetite and feel nauseous. 

I am working 2 jobs which I don't mind all too much. I recently started a gymnastics coaching job that is quite fun. From this job, I am learning to stand up for myself because there is a coworker who comes off rude and scolding towards me. This is something I would like to fix about myself. I am also learning this at my house because there is someone who disrespects me.

I am quite forgiving and naïve, so I would like to learn to how to be more quick witted and learn to stand up for myself more.

Nonetheless, I try my best to focus during lectures. Later on, I do get more energetic and enjoy my daily life as I hangout with my friends on campus or have small talk with strangers. Although its a little weird, I also find myself to be observative as I find interest in looking at random people or eavesdropping in conversations. I find a lot of my classes slow, so I end up multitasking listening to lecture and doing work on my laptop.

Overall I have a pretty busy course load but I find myself motivated when I'm on campus. Even on Tuesdays and Thursdays where I have labs and a full day of class, I still find it fun even if I'm really drained. On weekdays, I come back to my apartment at night and find joy in cooking as I like making new dishes, sometimes with the recipes from my mom. Afterwards I'm on my laptop where I talk and play video games with my friends on discord and/or do school work. Due to my abnormal sleep schedule I get really tired and will pass out on my chair or on my desk a lot of time for around 30 minutes to an hour almost everyday. My daily life is typically uneventful but on weekends I sometimes go to my friends' apartments or go out to downtown.

I wish I wasn't. But I think it stems from how I grew up. My parents were immigrants to the country and socializing for them was difficult, so I think it passed on to me and my siblings since we only socially interacted with a few people. Growing up I didn't see it as an issue but now it is something that I think about almost every day. I think I am mature in the sense that I understand a higher number of friends doesn't mean those friendships are of higher quality, but I do wish I had 1-3 friends that I could count on. So in that sense, I do feel lonely. I think it also doesn't help that as I am getting older, my parents talk about my getting married yet at the same time my mother says you don't have any friends, who will attend your wedding. Perhaps these kinds of comments make me more socially conscious lol.

In fact, I think my social anxiety is so bad that I become very anxious when it comes to presentations and speaking in front of audiences, even if it means answering questions in class. I have been trying to push myself to speak up in class and at least answer the questions I know the answer to for sure that my professors ask. But, for instance, I am supposed to give a presentation for my capstone project as a part of my degree and it makes me very worried. 

I think I am a patient and hardworking person. However, I do get tired easily. I was severely anemic, got treated for it, and it helped. But lately, I am starting to feel low on energy again. This becomes difficult for me as I am in the last semester of my master's program.

I try, and in fact, like to start my mornings early. I feel like I am more productive that way. But this becomes a problem for me when I sleep late. I try to sleep on time, but I live with my family and they're not used to it so it is often very difficult. The same goes for diet. I try to eat healthily but my family is picky. This brings me to my other point, that I moved back in with my family, and I feel like my real personality and behaviors are hidden now and rather restricted.

I'm 18 years old and I'm from a small town near Santa Cruz California. I'm currently a human development major and in hopes of pursuing a pathway in the medical field. Everyday I have a constant fear in the back of my head that if I don't succeed in one class, one test, it'll lead to the fear of not succeeding in my ultimate goal. Days that I have mid-terms are very difficult for me because I've never been the best at taking tests. 
On Mondays I start my day off pretty well because my class doesn't start until 12:30. I then therefore am able to either sleep in or go to the gym. I tend to be very eventful on this day because I have a lot of time in between to go to my next class at 6:10pm. Mondays and Wednesdays are the same schedule so they both tend to be the most beneficial days while  getting homework done. Tuesdays I have 3 classes so I tend to be more tired and less energetic. Thursdays tend to be one of the better days of the week. Thursdays have weirdly always been my favorite days of the week because the next day is Friday. On Fridays I don't have class so I have a lot of free time which is one of the reasons why I try to get ahead on homework. 
On a deeper note, I'm a second generation college student. Both of my parents graduated and attended college. Something that makes me self conscious is that both parents are successful especially my mother. Thats interesting to write but because my mother is very successful and it's very hard to tell her when I feel that I'm failing at something.

During winter quarter, everyday I woke up around 6-7 am to attend my morning classes. Even though I dread and hate waking up in the morning, I rather stay up at night, I do enjoy starting my day early. Most of my classes end before 1 so I spend most of my after noons doing assignments which makes feel happy and productive. However on Tuesday are my favourite days because I only have one class and it ends at 9:50, which gives me the whole day to catch up on my assignments and relaxing. After class if Im not working on assignments, I'm hanging out with my friends. We are either going out to eat, doing chores, or relaxing. 

In my day to day life I enjoy studying alone, but I also love studying in groups or pairs. Studying with other provides me comfort and give me opportunities to ask questions when I don't understand the homework. Besides the work aspect in my life I love taking naps especially after eating lunch. I often get tired after eating no matter if the food is healthy or not. In addition to getting tired after lunch, sometimes I get tired after to driving back and forth from school and home. Usually throughout a normal day my basic emotions range from being tired, happy, stressed, and relaxed.
